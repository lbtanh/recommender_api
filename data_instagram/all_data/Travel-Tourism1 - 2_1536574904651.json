In early 2014, I quit my Finance career to invest all of my time into crafting travel stories. \nSince then I've volunteered with tribes in Vietnam, kayaked in the Abel Tasman National Park in New Zealand, hiked in the fairytale landscape of Cappadocia in Turkey, on a glacier in Iceland and the rugged Eastern tip of Spain at Cap de Creus, consumed my weight in pasta in Italy, and been walked by a husky in the forests of Swedish Lapland. \n\nI'm a member of the Society of American Travel Writers (SATW), Adventure Travel Trade Association (ATTA), Professional Travel Bloggers Association \n(PTBA), International Travel Writers' Alliance and the iambassador bloggers' network. \nIn December 2017, I was featured as one of the top most influential Asians in the UAE by UAE-based Masala! Magazine. \n\nThe magic in travel comes from the ‘micro’ stories that we find only when we're compelled to think about what motivates, inspires, and encourages people to live the lives they do around the world. To find them we must observe, engage, converse, empathize, and truly experience. \n\nAnd that is exactly what my work seeks to do; to encourage my audience to make the most of their travels by traveling deeper versus faster. On TheBohoChica.com the focus is on stories, photography, videos, & tips about cultural experiences, new cuisines, & hiking adventures. Articles are a mix of destination guides, photo-essays, narratives, and opinion pieces. \n\nI am a UAE Correspondent for Forbes Travel Guide. I contribute travel & lifestyle features & photography to International Traveller, Roads & Kingdoms, Marriott Traveler, Hilton Explore, InterContinental Life, Little Big Travellers (magazine by Holiday Inn), JetWings International (Jet Airways Inflight Magazine), Travel Mindset, GoOverseas.com, Forbes Travel Guide, Flight Network, good Magazine, Matador Network, Elite Daily, iExplore, The Culture-ist, and Expedia Singapore, among other publications.","demographics":"Female","website":"http://thebohochica.com"},{"categories":["Disney","Disneyland","Theme Parks","Travel And Tourism"],"location":"Orlando, Florida","name":"AllEarsNet","path":"https://influence.co/allearsnet","reach":"89.5k","engagementRate":"1.5%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/allearsnet"},{"follower":"17.4k","link":"https://instagram.com/allearsnet","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"63.9k","link":"https://twitter.com/AllEarsNet","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"8.2k","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/allearsnet/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/user/AllEarsNet","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"AllEarsNet became the pioneer of Disney Fan Sites in January 1996.

I'm Sam Ozer, a freelance content creator and copywriter who also runs the family travel blog, www.growinguptwo.com. I'm originally from Birmingham, UK, but now call the Turquoise Coast in Turkey my home. The blog is relatively new, set up September 2017, but it's growing fast. Take a look at the humorous rants, ravings and reviews on motherhood and raising young twin boys. Read what to do, where to go and real-life stories and case studies from families that love travel and those with a passion for Turkey - a country where you learn to expect the unexpected! \nIf you are interested in connecting with an engaged UK and European audience that travel regularly to the Med, or have a brand aimed at holidaymakers or parents e.g. toys, books, luggage, cosmetics, sun creams, travel accessories, flight or tour companies etc...get in touch. I do not believe in 'paid' likes, my audience are genuine and organically grown. Interested in knowing more?

Sair da zona de conforto não é tão complicado assim. Descobri que viajar é encontrar inúmeros paraísos pelo mundo, ou não, vivenciar histórias contada nos livros, nos jornais e revistas, conhecer novas culturas, fazer novos amigos e explorar lugares nunca imaginados antes. O mundo se abre na sua frente em um passe de mágica. A partir deste momento minhas duas vocações e paixões se unirão em uma só, viajar e comunicar tudo sobre o que vi e vivi.

This is where I met my soulmate, and in between our adventures, this is where we are currently based. \nMy motto? \nBe the change you want to see in the world. \nMy photography and my account tell my story.

I share my stories from travels, tips and recommendations and of course my thoughts. My writing is genuine, authentic in some way funny and sarcastic and people follow me for my stories, different view on travelling and for my honesty. I’ve trained my audience to read my captions, in every post I write they are waiting for a revelation, pun, joke, or some funny comment to seep between the lines somewhere. I try to be different than other travel girls and try to promote active lifestyle as opposed to lazy laying by the beach, my adventures are always full of activities, sports and exploration. My followers constantly inquire which transport, tours and accommodations I use and even which clothing brands I prefer to wear.","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.margventure.com"},{"categories":["Fashion","Lifestyle","Travel","Fashion Blogger","Travel And Tourism"],"location":"Tokyo, Tokyo, JP","name":"Kat  Based In Japan","path":"https://influence.co/life_in_tokyo","reach":"307k","engagementRate":"4.5%","likePerPost":"13.4k","commentPerPost":"196","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/life_in_tokyo"},{"follower":"305k","link":"https://instagram.com/life_in_tokyo","type":"Instagram Link Click"}],"bio":"","demographics":"Female","website":"http://liketk.it/2x5JM"}]
