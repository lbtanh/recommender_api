And for the past several years we’ve had a hell of a time doing it. Through our shared love of America’s native spirit, we’ve met new people, swapped stories and even starred in few of our own. \n\nBut, along the way, we realized we had stumbled into something far more interesting, and frankly more fulfilling, than whatever was in our glass at the time. A remarkable kinship – born in bourbon, but cemented through genuine curiosity for the world of liquor and the resulting unfiltered conversations we call banter. It’s a big reason we’re here today and the soul of what we’re planning for tomorrow. \n\nWe’ve got our sights on going beyond spreading the Bourbon Gospel. We’re looking to unite a band of curious drinkers, original thinkers and just downright candid folks over intoxicating conversation. In renewing our commitment to unpretentious booze reviews, approachable content, and honest barstool talk, we’re creating a community fueled by personal passion and opinion unlike any other. \n\nWith a colorful cast of characters – from professional palates and cocktail connoisseurs to casual drinkers and bottom-shelf dwellers – our opinions may be varied but our mission singular: to help you drink curious. Please, pull up a chair and let the banter begin.","demographics":"Male","website":"http://www.bourbonbanter.com"},{"categories":["Entertainment","Fashion","Lifestyle","Food And Drinks","Travel And Tourism"],"location":"Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur, MY","name":"sheezay","path":"https://influence.co/sheezay","reach":"161k","engagementRate":"3.7%","likePerPost":"3.2k","commentPerPost":"29","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/sheezay"},{"follower":"88.4k","link":"https://instagram.com/sheezay","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"55.9k","link":"http://facebook.com/163593816985403","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"17.6k","link":"https://twitter.com/hollaSheezay","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/sheezayofficial","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/user/wazzefaktv","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"I'm a Musician, Rapper, Singer, Writer, Actor, and Entrepreneur.

I'm Anna Nguyen. I'm a lifestyle and wedding photographer who likes to dabble in travel/landscape photography and curate appealing branding images to engage and inspire others. \n\nI'm also a college student based in the Bay Area, CA. I love to bring my camera with me, whether it be my sweet Canon 6D or my iPhone, almost everywhere I go to take pictures of my lovely friends, family, clients, me (shameless selfies), food, and more. \n\nSince I was little, my dream has always been to be something to help others, both humans and doggos, as either a vet, a detective, a psychologist, or a nurse. I'm currently working towards my Bachelor's in Communicative Disorders and Sciences (commonly known as Speech-Language Pathology) to become a speech-language pathologist/therapist to work with kiddos. My pipe dream has always also been to be in the creative field, and I've developed my zeal in photography for the past couple of years. I hope I get to fulfill one of my dreams full-time someday, or even one or the other part-time works too. Either way, I'd be filled with joy doing something that I love. \n\nI especially love to surround myself with greenery because I think nature is the perfect backdrop for anyone and any occasion, so you'll see a lot of that in my work. Like many photographers or artists, I tend to spot the beauty in people and places, and photography is such a wonderful, timeless way to enhance and share that beauty. I love to make people feel beautiful! \n\nLet's create to enhance your brand's beauty.","demographics":"Female, 21 years old","website":"http://www.annatnguyen.com"},{"categories":["Food And Drinks"],"location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","name":"Thegiftofgab","path":"https://influence.co/wehavethegiftofgab","reach":"583","engagementRate":"6.3%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/wehavethegiftofgab"},{"follower":"560","link":"https://instagram.com/wehavethegiftofgab","type":"Instagram Link Click"}],"bio":"","demographics":"Female","website":"https://m.soundcloud.com/gift-of-gab-134755367"},{"categories":["Desserts","Food","Food And Drinks","Food Brand"],"location":"Houston, Texas","name":"Woods Cakery Bakery LLC","path":"https://influence.co/woodscakerybakery","reach":"1.0k","engagementRate":"","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/woodscakerybakery"},{"follower":"987","link":"https://instagram.com/woodscakerybakery","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"51","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/WoodsCakery/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"}]},{"categories":["Music","Menswear","Lifestyle Tips","Food And Drinks"],"location":"Edmond, Oklahoma","name":"Geoff Odoi","path":"https://influence.co/geoffmodoi","reach":"4.8k","engagementRate":"8.1%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/geoffmodoi"},{"follower":"3.4k","link":"https://instagram.com/geoffmodoi","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"1.3k","link":"https://twitter.com/geoffreyodoi","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/geoffodoi","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"I'm a Strategic Communications major at the University of Central Oklahoma, hoping to work in the social media aspect of things.
