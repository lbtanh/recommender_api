During my blogging days, I've teamed up with multiple national and international beauty, fashion and lifestyle brands and shops, including RealHer Cosmetics, Dicharitzi, Havaianas, Bondi Sands and IWhite Teeth Whitening. I didn't want to give up blogging, so I decided to post my well written, honest and thorough reviews to Instagram and became a succesful micro blogger / Instagram influencer instead. By switching from being a blogger to being an Influencer, I was able to keep doing what I loved doing the most: blogging, helping others making decisions when buying beauty, fashion and lifestyle related items, having fun and talking and engaging with my lovely worldwide audience! \n\nMore recently I've finished several Instagram collaborations with Civilised Cosmetics, Frosteewhite, Snowfox Skincare, VitaJuwel Bottles, BeNatural Organics, Tyes By Tara, MakeUpDrop, Soque, Fashion and Trends, SkinMud, Misfit Elements, Cocoa Locks, and iDeal Of Sweden, to name a few. The final results are on my Instagram page now, which you can find in the Social Media links above this bio. I'm also one of the brand new official brand ambassadors for Sheree Cosmetics, a new natural and cruelty free cosmetic brand, for Rosefield Watches and for Soque, a funny socks webshop, and I'm in the middle of multiple other new collaborations with beauty, fashion and lifestyle brands. Yes, I'm a busy girl!   I'm getting excellent feedback from brands and shops, after working with them. I've been told several times I'm one of the most professional Influencers they've been working with and I'm told my photography is very pretty and professional too. \n\nI'm a huge beauty, fashion and health fan, and so is my audience. Not only do I love products that make me look and feel fashionable, healthy and beautiful, I also closely watch my ecological footprint and encourage my followers to do the same by posting about the environment and sustainability. I'm trying to make the world a better place, one step at a time. I love to show the world my take on beauty, fashion, health and sustainability and my go-to stores and webshops, my ideas, my style and my routines. \n\nIf you take a look at my Social Media accounts all together, you'll see I can count on 10.000+ lovely followers of all ages, genders and countries worldwide. Concerning my Instagram account, with an average of 90+ likes and 30+ comments a post, I have a engagement rating of over 7% and I always use multiple relevant hashtags and a nametag to accompany my attractive looking pictures or video's and I also use 1 particular and personal hashtag to group all my reviews: use #natjesreviews in your search to see and read all of my reviews at once. I use personal hastags for showing my product swatches, my outfits, my makeup looks and my beauty related stash too. Yes, every topic has it's own personal hashtag, which is an easy and convenient way to simplify all your searches!  Anyway, I also share my Instagram reviews to Pinterest and Twitter, to ensure a maximum amount of exposure worldwide. As you can see, all together, I have a followingbase of over 10.000 active and loyal fans. All my Social Media accounts are public and written in English. And if you rather want me to write a review directly on your website (or both your website and my social media), or any other website like Trustpilot, that's also a possibility. Let me put it this way: when collaborating with me, almost anything is possible!  \n\nLast but not least: I usually work on a gifting base, which means I don't get paid for my work as an influencer. Here's how it works: you send me the product or products you like me to review for free and in return, I write a honest and thorough review to promote your webshop or brand to my followers, also for free. The only thing I ask for, in return for the hard work I'm putting in writing this review, is for me to keep the product I'm reviewing / promoting, because that way, it's the most beneficial for the both of us. My ultimate goal isn't just providing my followers with quality content, but also building a longlasting relationship with the brand, providing them with new customers and beautiful pictures they can use on their own pages and website! \n\nWell, that's about it I guess. If you have any questions, concerns, thoughts or ideas, feel free to contact me! \n\nI hope we can collaborate and I love to hear from you soon. \n\nThanks for reading and have a nice day! \n\nLove, \nNathalie","demographics":"Female, 35 years old","website":"https://lnk.bio/PKul"},{"categories":["Adventure Travel","Fashion","Lifestyle","Travel"],"follower":"14.5k","location":"Copenhagen, Capital Region, DK","name":"Annika Morck","path":"https://influence.co/annieverywhere","reach":"14.5k","engagementRate":"6.4%","likePerPost":"785","commentPerPost":"18","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/annieverywhere"},{"follower":"12.4k","link":"https://instagram.com/annieverywhere","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"436","link":"http://facebook.com/1399772423375887","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"940","link":"http://www.annieverywhere.com","type":"Blog Link Click"},{"follower":"435","link":"https://twitter.com/Annieverywhere1","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"244","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/annieverywhere/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-l77YbEE_Tb7oSo8ivftcg?view_as=subscriber","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"I'm a Danish travel blogger/Instagrammer traveling around the world and sharing my adventures.

I am Pari. I am an avid traveler, a k-drama fan, a wife and a fashionable nerd. \n\nI was born with a wanderlust that I had no means of satisfying. Growing up I had one thing going for me - I was slightly above average in academics. So, I worked hard thinking that education would open doors for me... and it did! I traveled to many countries to attend and present at conferences.However, secretly I wished to skip the conference and explore the beautiful city I had traveled to. \n\nAfter the PhD I had two choices: academia or travel. For a year I chose the safe option: academia. It did not fulfill me. So, here I am taking the biggest risk of my life, jumping in head first into becoming a full time travel and fashion influencer and blogger. \n\nThrough my stories and pictures, I hope to inspire others to travel more and live their dream.

So I guess the ‘closet’ now contains everything including the kitchen sink.","demographics":"Female","website":"http://lcscloset.com/"},{"categories":["Beauty","Fashion","Travel","Travel Photography","Lifestyle Photography"],"follower":"53.9k","location":"Delray Beach, Florida","name":"Taylor Fuller","path":"https://influence.co/taylor_fuller","reach":"53.9k","engagementRate":"3.2%","likePerPost":"1.1k","commentPerPost":"112","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/taylor_fuller"},{"follower":"36.3k","link":"https://instagram.com/taylor_fuller","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"834","link":"http://facebook.com/1384786858422499","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"13.5k","link":"http://www.travelcolorfully.com","type":"Blog Link Click"},{"follower":"1.1k","link":"https://twitter.com/taylor_fuller","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"2.2k","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/Taylorfuller91/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylorfuller","type":"LinkedIn Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/tayfulls","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/c/taylorfullerwg","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"Taylor Fuller is a travel writer and photographer.

They can not only taste (and discern culinary magic), but they can express themselves with precision and eloquence that is rare. Essentially they are media professionals who not only fell in love with each other but also with cuisine of all types. And as their love for each other grew, food became a passion for them! \n\nIn May 2015, they gave birth to “The Guiltless Foodies” which expresses very aptly their zest for good food. Their adventurous spirit takes them to distant corners as they pursue their quest for culinary masterpieces. They have travelled ‘the road not taken’ to explore promising and upcoming food outlets. Very importantly they have covered all types of places from fine dine, mid level to small places that are way off the culinary circuit.\n\nTheir eagle eye for detail and discerning taste buds has played a pivotal role in mapping the ever changing culinary landscape of the city. They have travelled hundreds of kilometres to understand and relish good food and they are always gung ho about tasting and testing new food opportunities. It’s hardly a surprise to learn that they are the winner of “Best Restaurant Review” by the Food Blogger Association of India. \n\nYes, this gourmand couple has many 'meals' to go before they sleep!","demographics":"Male","website":"https://guiltlessfoodies.wordpress.com"},{"categories":["Fashion","Home Decorating","Lifestyle","Travel","Fashion & Beauty"],"follower":"10.4k","location":"Salt Lake City, Utah","name":"Mindie","path":"https://influence.co/astylishcloset","reach":"10.4k","engagementRate":"6.1%","likePerPost":"580","commentPerPost":"5","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/astylishcloset"},{"follower":"9.6k","link":"https://instagram.com/astylishcloset","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"9.0","link":"http://facebook.com/1332697833460060","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"42","link":"https://twitter.com/mindiepack","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"792","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/mindiep/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"}],"bio":"My name is Mindie and I'm the creative and founder behind the blog A Stylish Closet, a blog created to inspire women to pursue a vibrant life through fashion, travel, family, and home.","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.astylishcloset.com"},{"categories":["Beauty","Fashion","Lifestyle"],"follower":"25.9k","location":"Brooklyn, New York","name":"emanimone","path":"https://influence.co/emanimone","reach":"25.9k","engagementRate":"3.3%","likePerPost":"489","commentPerPost":"12","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/emanimone"},{"follower":"15.4k","link":"https://instagram.com/emanimone","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"9.7k","link":"https://twitter.com/EmaniMone","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"834","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/emanimone/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/EmaniMone","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/user/emanimonej","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"","demographics":"Female","website":"http://emanimone.com/"},{"categories":["Beauty","Fashion","Hair Care","Makeup","Fashion Blogger"],"follower":"25.7k","location":"Seattle, Washington","name":"dailyfashionmuse","path":"https://influence.co/dailyfashionmuse","reach":"25.7k","engagementRate":"3.1%","likePerPost":"133","commentPerPost":"3","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/dailyfashionmuse"},{"follower":"4.3k","link":"https://instagram.com/dailyfashionmuse","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"324","link":"http://facebook.com/193492637450592","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"1.8k","link":"http://dailyfashionmuse.com","type":"Blog Link Click"},{"follower":"3.1k","link":"https://twitter.com/dailyfashionmus","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"16.2k","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/dailyfashionmus/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anne-dofelmier-88334366","type":"LinkedIn Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/Dailyfashionmus","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC43mHuMUmHSgztex2_akGQw","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"I am Anne and I am a blogger, photographer, and personal stylist.

He resided in Istanbul till he was 13 years old, where he participated in various team sports together with individual performance sports. \n\nIn 2003, he moved to Barcelona, Spain with his family. He concentrated on excelling at basketball with the goal of playing for FC Barcelona Basquet and simultaneously competed in an amateur full contact kick boxing league. \n\nIn 2006, via a self-initiated weight cut, he found cysts on his body that needed to be surgically removed as the tissues could potentially carry cancer cells. Following the operation, he then noticed an abnormality on his left leg. What appeared to be a harsh bruise turned out to be a bone tumor on his left femur. \n\nAfter a successful 7-hour surgery, the large tumor was removed and the femur was reinforced with a strip of cadaver bone. The operation rendered Ilkay unable to move without walking aids for the duration of two years. Doctors told him he may never be able to walk again. \n\nIlkay refused to accept the fate that was instilled by the doctors and heavily invested his time in rehab. In 2010, he decided to move to Montreal to continue his BCOMM education at a prestigious business school in Montreal, JMSB of Concordia University. \n\nHe fully recovered from his operation and decided to take up martial arts. The relentless effort displayed by Ilkay led him to become a very talented mixed martial artist after 3 years of consistent training for over 4 hours (on average) a day. With the aid of his instructors, Sifu Sebastien and Kru Ryan Parsons, he started teaching mixed martial arts to others. He is currently training to fight at a heavier weight class. \n\nOn the business side, Ilkay has worked in a variety of industries, such as retail & wholesale jewelry, interior design, electronics manufacturing services, SaaS, and the Fitness & Wellness industry. He assumed positions in Sales, Business Development, and Customer Success in the companies he worked with. \n\nUsing his knowledge and experience gathered throughout his lifetime via practicing various types of functional and strength based sports, he has created the world’s most balanced training methodology, LIBRAFORTE.","demographics":"Male","website":"http://www.IlkaySky.com"},{"categories":["Fashion","Lifestyle","Makeup","Photography","YouTube"],"follower":"1.6k","location":"Paris, Île-de-France, FR","name":"surulere","path":"https://influence.co/surulere","reach":"3.0k","engagementRate":"6.6%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/surulere"},{"follower":"1.4k","link":"https://instagram.com/surulere","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"177","link":"https://twitter.com/NancyNtanda","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/Mrs.naancy","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-dAhpjNlWXBuSkOEMLqAEQ","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"A M B I T I O U S \n Paris \n nancyntanda@gmail.com \n Follow me on Snap  Mrs.naancy \n Beauty, Fashion and Lifestyle \n Check out my Last post","demographics":"Female, 21 years old","website":"https://youtu.be/Y-KPTU3PNNw"},{"categories":["Beauty","Cars","Fashion","Travel"],"follower":"9.7k","location":"San Francisco, California","name":"Carlos Roberto","path":"https://influence.co/bycarlosroberto","reach":"19.2k","engagementRate":"8.0%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/bycarlosroberto"},{"follower":"9.6k","link":"https://instagram.com/bycarlosroberto","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"111","link":"http://facebook.com/1194771873928308","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-McDALGR_39SXl2aYNDNvQ","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"Mens Fashion storyteller though attitude and style.

Pugi came from a family of industrialists involved in the textile industry therefore opening a door for him into the fashion world. Franco began his career driven by his passion and desire to revisit the authenticity of Italian craftsmanship and expertise. The company logo, two galloping horses, was designed to represent the successful collaboration between Franco and his wife Elena in both life and work. During the 80’s and 90’s the business grew exponentially and the FrancoPugi brand achieved great recognition for its bags and accessories not only in Italy but in America and Japan as well. Having achieved much success Franco and his family decided to make their home in South America. After being away for ten years and with much encouragement from his daughter, Lara, Franco felt that it was time to return to Italy to relaunch the business. With great enthusiasm, energy and the support of a talented team Franco is inspired to realize his many projects and dreams. Franco Pugi bags with their original designs are colorful and versatile making them attractive to women all over the world. They carry the “Made in Italy” label as they are handmade with great care and attention to detail by Italian artisans.","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.francopugi.com"},{"categories":["Beauty","Fashion","Lifestyle","Social Media","Travel"],"follower":"5.8k","location":"Chattanooga, Tennessee","name":"ashleeeliz","path":"https://influence.co/ashleeeliz","reach":"6.8k","engagementRate":"8.5%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/ashleeeliz"},{"follower":"1.0k","link":"https://instagram.com/ashleeeliz","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"3.9k","link":"https://twitter.com/ashleelizdotcom","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"797","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/ashleelizdotcom/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/ashleestuart","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"Lifestyle and Beauty Blogger","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.ashleeliz.com/"},{"categories":["Fashion","Lifestyle","Travel","Menswear","Cocktails"],"follower":"3.3k","location":"Seattle, Washington","name":"Joe Gooding","path":"https://influence.co/joedujour","reach":"4.6k","engagementRate":"10.7%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/joedujour"},{"follower":"1.4k","link":"https://instagram.com/joedujour","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"559","link":"http://facebook.com/194436192130","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"180","link":"http://thebeau.co","type":"Blog Link Click"},{"follower":"1.1k","link":"https://twitter.com/joedujour","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"69","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/joedujour/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joegooding","type":"LinkedIn Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/jgooding92","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFiLHKuPn-aVppIZjix_6Xg","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"My name is Joe Gooding and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of the BEAU, an online lifestyle destination for the modern, fashionable man.

Thus it is we, ourselves who transport art through time. \n\nThe objective of Kingdomz X Magazine is to ignite passion and to stimulate that positive, mind-blowing feeling that fuels each one of us to create.","demographics":"Male","website":"https://www.kingdomzx.com"},{"categories":["Art and Artists","Fashion","Food and Drink","Inspiration","Music"],"follower":"858","location":"India","name":"Snapchat : journeyoung","path":"https://influence.co/_journeyoung","reach":"858","engagementRate":"9.5%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/_journeyoung"},{"follower":"350","link":"https://instagram.com/_journeyoung","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"508","link":"http://facebook.com/633242476791379","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikita-jain-706b9456","type":"LinkedIn Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/journeyoung","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"journeYoung is an accolade to some amazingly creative sky heads, fascinating professions, and all the super cool folks! journeYoung is an inspirational blog folio, a documentation of everyone who is victorious in their lives!

I still live in Michigan when I'm not traveling. I am a resort business owner that owns a marina, RV resorts and a beach shop. \n\nI started a food blog called 'Boating, Boarding & Burgers' in the summer of 2014 and it really took off. In the past two years, I have been featured by The TODAY Show Food Club, ABC The Chew, The Rachael Ray Show, NYCWFF and I was even on Good Morning America. Keep in touch with me on my new site \"Nom News\". I'll be bringing you the best food from the North, East, West & South...to your mouth! \n\nIn just the last 24 months, I have done over 30 live on-air food segments. I have been on Good Morning America in NYC, WZZM TV13, Fox 17 and Eight West in Grand Rapids, WTSP Studio 10 Live in Tampa/Sarasota and WISH-TV IndyStyle in Indianapolis. Live TV is so much fun, it's an adrenaline rush. I am also a TODAY Show Food Contributor as well as a Jeep Talk Show Contributor. \n\nIn the summer, I stay busy with the businesses. But in my off -time, I love to go Jeeping, snowmobiling, stand up paddle boarding and boating. We travel from September through April, so check out my social media channels and follow me as I blog about food, fashion, travel and more.","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.nomnews.com"},{"categories":["Fashion","Food and Drink","Makeup","Travel"],"follower":"1.4k","location":"France","name":"ameliebc","path":"https://influence.co/ameliebc","reach":"1.4k","engagementRate":"7.6%","likePerPost":"85","commentPerPost":"1","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/ameliebc"},{"follower":"1.1k","link":"https://instagram.com/ameliebc","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"113","link":"https://twitter.com/ameliebellemin","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"161","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/ameliebellemin/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"}],"bio":"French fashion lifestyle blogger","demographics":"Female, 26 years old","website":"http://www.400ruemarieanneest.com"},{"categories":["Cosmetics","Fashion","Style","Model","Lifestyle Photography"],"follower":"3.7k","location":"Israel","name":"pl.milana","path":"https://influence.co/pl.milana","reach":"7.5k","engagementRate":"4.3%","likePerPost":"154","commentPerPost":"8","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/pl.milana"},{"follower":"3.7k","link":"https://instagram.com/pl.milana","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.periscope.tv/plmilana/#share","type":"Periscope Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/plmilana","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://www.youtube.com/c/MilanaPlaksina","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"Milana Plaksina \nFashion/Style/Travel/Instagram lover \nModel \nLifestyle photographer \nYouTube blogger \nDancer/Singer \nAlways behind to a cooperation and an advertising!","demographics":"Female, 20 years old","website":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFPvDfqcwtg"},{"categories":["Fashion","Makeup","Style","makeup blogger"],"follower":"2.1k","location":"New York","name":"makeupbykifana","path":"https://influence.co/makeupbykifana","reach":"2.1k","engagementRate":"3.6%","likePerPost":"40","commentPerPost":"3","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/makeupbykifana"},{"follower":"1.2k","link":"https://instagram.com/makeupbykifana","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"393","link":"http://facebook.com/147130611964242","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"287","link":"https://twitter.com/makeupbykifana","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"254","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/makeupbykifana/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/makeupbykifana","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/user/montREALady","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"I'm a freelance makeup artist and fashion stylist on the side of my 9-5. \n\nFASHION AND MAKE-UP EXPERIENCE: •Continuously establishing make-up experience and building portfolio. •Make-up artist for dancers, photo shoots and bride/bridal parties. •Dresser for major designers at New York/Mercedes Benz Fashion Week (since 2005), Montreal Fashion Week and Montreal Festival of Fashion. •Wardrobe Stylist for music events and photo shoots.

She got to sit in the second row as an attendee and it hit her that she actually didn't have to work a show for the first time. It was a great feeling and accomplishment since she's always dreamed of being an attendee. Rhea then started Sew Stylish Rhea to share her sewing projects, her passion for fashion from her personal style, fabric shopping, and fashion/beauty events she attends. In 2013 she collaborated with The Mobile Media Lab and Insta Meet for New York Fashion Week, where she was one of the selected Instagrammer's to attend Tommy Hilfiger's Fall 2014 Fashion show. She got to take pictures of behind the scenes and capture images of the fashion show, meet Tommy in person too which was also a wonderful experience.","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.sewstylishrhea.blogspot.com"},{"categories":["Design","Fashion","Lifestyle","Style","Food Styling"],"follower":"789","location":"Nashville, Tennessee","name":"Kirsten Anja Pohle","path":"https://influence.co/kirstenanjapohle","reach":"1.3k","engagementRate":"10.7%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/kirstenanjapohle"},{"follower":"553","link":"https://instagram.com/kirstenanjapohle","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"80","link":"http://facebook.com/1065773753500208","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"156","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/kirstenpohle/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirstenanjapohle","type":"LinkedIn Link Click"}],"bio":"I'm a wardrobe and food stylist based in Nashville, TN.

With building a following, she has got over 2000 followers who also enjoy her other types of content. \n\nWith this account, she is hoping to inspire others to get creative and that anyone regardless of gender, age, body shape, size, race, and so on can take part in cosplay.

Out on the first Friday of each month, featuring the best slow fashion, organic skincare and sustainable brands as well as features on ecology, parenting, good eating and wellbeing. In addition to the monthly digital magazine, we share articles, reviews, insights and news stories on our website. We also produce films of our unique recipes and produce regular gift guides to showcase and celebrate our favourite eco-friendly and sustainable products. \n\nAt Natural Mumma we love good food, great style and beautiful objects that don’t cost the earth. We believe in clean beauty, chemical free skincare and limiting our exposure to harmful toxins. \n\nWe accept that being the best we can be is the only sort of perfection worth striving for, and when it comes to lifestyle choices there are limits to what can be achieved. We love the sense of story that comes with an ethical lifestyle; from knowing the origins of a garment to expressing your own character through your individual style – ethical fashion doesn’t just mean quality, it connects us to the global community. You can keep your carbon footprint small, even in the most beautiful footwear. We believe that every day is worthy of red lipstick, especially when it has been made with thought and consideration. \n\nNatural Mumma was founded by Holly Daffurn, whose journalistic career spans across beauty, fashion, art, music and travel. Holly’s book ‘The Natural Baby: A gentle guide to conception, pregnancy, birth & beyond’ was published internationally by Green Books in 2017 and takes the reader through a healthy pregnancy through yoga, healthy eating and reducing dangerous chemicals. She has also written several ebooks around parenting, miscarriage and separation (also published by Green Books). Holly’s experience includes being an official vlogger for Channel Mum and a columnist for The Green Parent Magazine. Before becoming editor in chief of Natural Mumma Magazine she wrote for a wealth of publications including Natural Health, Parents Magazine, The Ecologist, My Green Pod (a supplement of The Guardian) and DIVA.","demographics":"Female, 35 years old","website":"http://www.naturalmumma.com/"},{"categories":["Fashion","Lifestyle","Travel","Model","Photographer"],"follower":"6.3k","location":"Santa Pola, Valencia, ES","name":"alexandravuiu","path":"https://influence.co/alexandravuiu","reach":"6.3k","engagementRate":"1.8%","likePerPost":"44","commentPerPost":"1","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/alexandravuiu"},{"follower":"2.5k","link":"https://instagram.com/alexandravuiu","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"199","link":"https://twitter.com/alexandravuiu","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"294","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/AlexandraVuiu/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandravuiu","type":"LinkedIn Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/alexandravuiu","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU9QSn4xSJjMq5mhQzTWzQg","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"Photographer, model, actress and Romanian retoucher with head office in Spain - Alicante. \nHer t target is to find and capture the beauty of the model in every photo.

I was craving more so I packed my bags and moved to Chicago to attend Makeup First School where I became a Certified makeup artist. That was just not enough for me so I proceeded to enroll myself in Tricoci University's Esthetician program, so I am now a licensed esthetician. \n\nI have been trained in various forms of makeup applications: color theory, high-definition, theatrical, beauty, media, wedding, runway/fashion, clinical, special FX, and editorial.

Ever since I can remember my life has revolved around fashion. I picked up my first Vogue Magazine at age six and spent more time worrying about my outfit and when I could go shopping again then anything else. As a Southern California native I was always surrounded by fashion but it wasn't until my family relocated to Houston that I really knew I had found my calling. I did my first internship at Nordstrom at age 17 and then headed off to college to major in Fashion Marketing. As I was halfway through my degree I realized that my love of fashion was too much to NOT share it with the world and Stylelista Confessions was born. \n\nNow seven years later, I am living in the crazy city of Los Angeles working full time in marketing and continuing my love of blogging full time as well. My goal for this blog was to share all the amazing things I love in the world of fashion but also finding the alternative that is attainable for myself and I continue to do that in each and every post I share. I want everyone to leave knowing exactly how to embrace their inner stylelista! I love hearing from my readers, who are the ones that make this blog possible, so PLEASE give me a shout out I would love to hear from you!","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.stylelistaconfessions.com"},{"categories":["Beauty","Fashion","Makeup","YouTube","Beauty Blogger"],"follower":"7.4k","location":"Hayward, California","name":"Jennifer Trujillo","path":"https://influence.co/jennytrujillo_","reach":"7.4k","engagementRate":"19.1%","likePerPost":"1.3k","commentPerPost":"16","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/jennytrujillo_"},{"follower":"7.0k","link":"https://instagram.com/jennytrujillo_","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"428","link":"https://twitter.com/jennytrujillo_","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/jenny.dfwu","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2ZOAdFAO_D8DtI2Twd-2g","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"Check out my YouTube channel where I do makeup looks, vlogs, and soon challenges.

He was responsible for creating and executing marketing strategies that coordinated print, social media and e-mail advertising, stemming from conceptualizing and directing The Met’s campaign photoshoots as well as the development of a newly launched website in November 2014; Evan was the editor of themetsarasota.com and The Met’s blog, The Met Edit. \n\nEvan has since moved back to his hometown of Milwaukee, WI, where he is finishing his minor in French Business from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and splits his time between Chicago and Milwaukee. Evan will be applying to schools to finish his major in January 2017. \n\nSPOKEN FOR launched in August 2016 under the notion that style can be spoken for by all of us.
