Instagram is my main platform, as I love the simplicity of sharing photos I enjoy and creating a cohesive gallery. \n\nI look forward to interacting and meeting with all types of brands.","demographics":"Female, 22 years old","website":"http://goo.gl/1pFZx4"},{"categories":["Fashion","Inspiration","Lifestyle","Music","Photography"],"follower":"27.0k","location":"Denver, Colorado","name":"K A Y T E  D E M O N T ️","path":"https://influence.co/massmusings","reach":"27.0k","engagementRate":"2.5%","likePerPost":"598","commentPerPost":"10","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/massmusings"},{"follower":"24.5k","link":"https://instagram.com/massmusings","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"1.4k","link":"https://twitter.com/Mass_Musings","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"1.2k","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/massmusings/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaytedemont","type":"LinkedIn Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/kayte.demont","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"Founder/Editor of Mass Musings - \nLifestyle + Music Collective Denver \n: kayte@massmusings.com \n: kayte.demont \n#massmusings","demographics":"Female","website":"http://massmusings.com/"},{"categories":["Beauty","Fashion","Travel","Bikini","Fashion Blogger"],"follower":"48.9k","location":"Genoa, Liguria, IT","name":"thepeacocksvoice","path":"https://influence.co/thepeacocksvoice","reach":"48.9k","engagementRate":"3.6%","likePerPost":"1.6k","commentPerPost":"25","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/thepeacocksvoice"},{"follower":"45.2k","link":"https://instagram.com/thepeacocksvoice","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"3.3k","link":"http://facebook.com/589281937748748","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"378","link":"https://twitter.com/PeacocksVoice","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"29","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/PeacocksVoice/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/thepeacocksvoice","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"Hi! :-) My name is Francesca, I am 25 and I am an Italian Influencer and Blogger since 2012 who loves Beauty, Fashion and Nature. \nAt present I am brand ambassador for HAWKERS & Co and JORD Wood Watches.

I'm Elika, you can call me \"ika\" for short. \nI am an aspiring young Graphic Designer, but more of a Creative Artist. \nMy ability to see art and beauty in everything and creating what I call \"Magic\" is what I love doing. (To know more about me, click on my other Social Media accounts and get a whole lot of information :D). \n\nBut I also love Photography, Videography, Singing!, Dancing and Fashion. \nI love to take everything to what I see as 'Aesthetically Beautiful'. I don't have a specified genre of what I put in my content, as long as I see it beautiful and pleasing I put it up for everyone to see what I see. \n\nI sing and I post them up in my SoundCloud Profile and my Youtube Channel as well. Since I am an artist, I draw Anime characters mostly in Pen-&-Ink medium, also Wild Animals, I find them really connecting with the Inner Animal Spirit. \n\nI dress up and I love it! I enjoy travelling, taking photos of my journey.

Stuart continued to pursue her passion both behind and in front of the camera, as an Entertainment Correspondent for ABC's On the Red Carpet; Reality TV Casting Director for over 15 television series for NBC, VH1 and MTV; Host of Ovation TV's Culture Pop and Broadway Bash; and as a Live Red Carpet Host for multiple Dick Clark Productions awards shows including The Golden Globes, American Music Awards and Independent Spirit Awards. Somehow, Stuart even found the time to license a television pilot to the CW Network for a show she also co-created, produced and starred in. \n\nClearly not one to wait for opportunities, Stuart then created her own branded platform StuartSays.com to share her life's passions with over 250,000 active and engaged followers. She's embraced the rapidly evolving media landscape, creating her own content for numerous digital and social media platforms in addition to Hosting and Producing Studio Wrap for TheWrap.com, featuring interviews with the industry's elite and breakout stars. You can also find Stuart regularly hosting A-list movie junkets and global premieres for AMC Theaters and as a pop culture and social media expert on KTLA, HLN and Reelz. \n\nIt should come as no surprise that Stuart has some thrilling new adventures in her immediate future, not the least of which is motherhood!

We've built the site to be our readers’ go-to source for information or inspiration on a certain topic. We've been intentional about building these relationships, and because of that relationship, our readers trust our judgement when it comes to booking their next trips or bringing suggestions to the table for where they wish to splash out for their luxury vacation of choice. This is what we strive for, and indeed pride ourselves on through our emphasis on detailed, honest, relatable, advisory and fun-to-read reviews. \n\nHashtagLife covers world wide luxury destinations for a readership which is made up of corporate and business subscribers and young travelers and adults looking for adventure and escape. Our luxury lifestyle and travel magazine focuses on delivering high-end, beautiful, honest, and witty travel ideas that are most important of all: tangible. We deliver to our readers trips of a lifetime to destinations near and far within the luxury arena. Having covered several 5* destinations within Europe such as The Rixos Istanbul and Bodrum, and the Boutique Hotels of the Amalfi Coast, Italy, we have this year expanded our global reach to the Caribbean. \n\nWe have covered high profile destinations and have teamed up with names such as The Viceroy, The Ritz, The Aman Resorts, Kempinski, Eden Roc, to name but a few. Our social media following is prominent and continues to grow, having attracted 100,000 thousand followers over just a few months. \n\nOur recent review of Jade Mountain, St Lucia, received over 69,000 unique hits and was also picked up and featured by the St Lucia Tourism Board due to its popularity. \n\nIn addition, we have produced hugely popular gastro-pieces; with our visit to the Fairmont Monte Carlo and interview with Chef Nobu attracting 92,000 unique visitors to the site in one month.","demographics":"Female, 29 years old","website":"http://www.hashtaglife.co.uk"},{"categories":["Beauty","Fashion","Lifestyle","Shopping","Blogger"],"follower":"109k","location":"Los Angeles, California","name":"Daphne Blunt","path":"https://influence.co/daphneblunt","reach":"166k","engagementRate":"3.2%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/daphneblunt"},{"follower":"57.7k","link":"https://instagram.com/daphneblunt","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"5.8k","link":"http://facebook.com/113553696179","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"44.3k","link":"https://twitter.com/daphneblunt","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"1.3k","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/daphneblunt/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/daphneblunt","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://www.youtube.com/daphneblunt","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"Allow me to introduce, myself you lovely reader you.

If you want in on the secret behind the name… it’s a play on words referencing To Sir, With Love the beloved 1967 classic by Lulu. \n\nIn a nutshell I am an old soul with a shopping addiction and a passport stamp collection and one too many pairs of shoes.

I hope to provide looks that allow my readers to add their own personal style and feel confident about their appearance.","demographics":"Female","website":"http://whatwouldkikiwear.com"},{"categories":["Fashion","Food and Drink","Kids and Babies","Fashion Blogger","Family Lifestyle"],"follower":"49.1k","location":"Atlanta, Georgia","name":"Claire Cervino","path":"https://influence.co/claire_cervino","reach":"76.7k","engagementRate":"1.4%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/claire_cervino"},{"follower":"27.7k","link":"https://instagram.com/claire_cervino","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"8.3k","link":"https://twitter.com/ClaireCervino","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"13.2k","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/clairecervino/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/clairecervino","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"Family.

I was nervous that I had this big responsibility, but my friend’s belief in me gave me confidence in my work. When her and her family saw the photos after the wedding, they were thrilled. They loved that they were simple but beautiful. \nThis experience instilled in me the idea of creating my own body of work and branching out into photography for different events and occasions. \nI am constantly working to develop my expertise in this field and keeping my knowledge up to date.","demographics":"Female","website":"https://www.facebook.com/MennaNabilPhotography/"},{"categories":["Fashion","Tea","Make Up, Beauty Blogger"],"follower":"24.0k","location":"Palermo, Sicily, IT","name":"Ida ॐ","path":"https://influence.co/awilou","reach":"42.0k","engagementRate":"2.9%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/awilou"},{"follower":"18.0k","link":"https://instagram.com/awilou","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"5.7k","link":"https://twitter.com/enchvntedlou","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"271","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/idalicata/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/itsidax","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"","demographics":"Female, 21 years old","website":"http://arouis.tumblr.com"},{"categories":["Beauty","Fashion","Lifestyle","Style","Blogger"],"follower":"10.8k","location":"Ljubljana, Ljubljana, SI","name":"Sara Zavernik","path":"https://influence.co/theblondebliss","reach":"21.6k","engagementRate":"3.2%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/theblondebliss"},{"follower":"10.8k","link":"https://instagram.com/theblondebliss","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-zavernik-6497b020","type":"LinkedIn Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/sarazavernik","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"I am a young style blogger that loves fashion in every single form.

My name is Emma and I'm 25 years old. I'm born and raised in The Netherlands. I'm having MS & Lyme Disease and I'm traveling the world for treatments. While doing treatments I'm more determined than ever to rise and shine, and definitely not letting my diseases define me. I did a lot of collaborations for over the past years, and I think because of my illnesses I am a really hard working woman and not letting ANYTHING come in my way if I want to achieve it. I want to show my followers that Fashion is fun and you can do so much with it, as well with beauty and health products. \nWhat you see is what you get with me, my previous clients from collaborations were immediately positive when I send them my pictures, and I'm always updating them whenever I got the product and if I'm having pictures ready etc. I'm doing everything myself, from the creative part of where to shoot, the modeling part, the editing, just everything you can think of. \nFor different treatments for my health, I lived in Florida (Tampa/Clearwater Beach Area) and in Los Angeles. I loved living in such different cities, it inspires me and I learned a lot from it. \nI'm also graduated as a Nutritionist, so my passions really are Fashion, Beauty and Health. I'm now back in the Netherlands, and I'm pregnant with our first child! \nDo you want to see more? Please send an email so I can send you my portfolio! Would love to hear from you! - Emma","demographics":"Female, 26 years old","website":"http://nouw.com/lifestylebyemma"},{"categories":["Animals","Fashion","Food and Drink","Fundraising","Pets"],"follower":"35.9k","location":"Los Angeles, California","name":"Abbey Bella","path":"https://influence.co/abbeybellacavalier","reach":"35.9k","engagementRate":"3.1%","likePerPost":"1.1k","commentPerPost":"18","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/abbeybellacavalier"},{"follower":"35.6k","link":"https://instagram.com/abbeybellacavalier","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"235","link":"https://twitter.com/abbeybellacav","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/Abbeybellacav","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"I am a fluffy, fashionable, and socially aware Cavalier King Charles Spaniel loving life in Southern California.

Soon enough I had a photographer take me on as an apprentice. After meeting people and getting my name out there. I was soon pulled into the other side of the lense. When models flaked or when a photographer has a personal project I was there. From there everything exploded. I was published in playboy and cosmopolitan for my costume making, modeling, and hair and makeup. From there I put my heels in the dirt and started branding myself. I now work for verious brands and companies doing everything from. Modeling, in house marketing, social media marketing, photography, and event promotion. I never represent a product or company I wouldn't use myself, or dont like. I always put a 100% effort into each and every one of my clients even for my most basoc of packages.

Having dedicated time to personally develop her craft of songwriting and artistry, Alexx is set to impact the music scene with an infectious blend of appealing electronic, alternative and pop elements. Most recently, Alexx independently released her highly anticipated EP, \"Like We're Famous\" – a flirtatious and infectious collection of songs that have received accolades from leading industry outlets such as Billboard, Spin, Paper Mag, Idolator and Noisey Vice. \n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, and raised in Jupiter, Florida, Alexx was introduced to her passion for music at a very early age. By the age of only seven, Alexx began penning her own songs and continued to develop her writing the same time as she was exploring her individuality. Witnessing the talent at hand, her parents encouraged Alexx to pursue music seriously throughout her education. Graduating from high school a year early, Alexx headed west to LA where she was quickly inspired by the energy and creativity of her new surroundings. Through collaborating with local producers and writers, Alexx recorded early competitive material that found its way to influential taste makers and industry professionals. In a short amount of time, Alexx secured a world-wide publishing deal with BMG, which then in turn allowed her the independence to identify her own brand as an artist. \n\nSince the release of “Like We’re Famous,” Alexx has been featured on leading outlets such as BBC Radio 1, iHeart Media and SiriusXM. In March, 2016, Alexx released a remix of “Sunglasses” with DJ/Producer GOLDHOUSE. Also in March, Alexx performed two shows at South by Southwest, to rave reviews. In addition to her solo efforts, Alexx collaborated with DJ/Producer John Dahlback on his Armada Records EDM single, “Count To Ten,” which has amassed over 1,000,000 plays on Spotify. Alexx is currently in the studio writing for her next release in late 2016.","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.alexxmack.com"},{"categories":["Fashion","Inspiration","Marriage","Musician","Momlife"],"follower":"27.3k","location":"Nashville, Tennessee","name":"Amanda Patterson","path":"https://influence.co/amandawilcoxpatterson","reach":"27.3k","engagementRate":"4.4%","likePerPost":"608","commentPerPost":"14","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/amandawilcoxpatterson"},{"follower":"14.1k","link":"https://instagram.com/amandawilcoxpatterson","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"10.5k","link":"http://facebook.com/258782170897911","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"2.7k","link":"https://twitter.com/IAmAmandaNoelle","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"34","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/IAmAmandaNoelle/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-patterson-24332796","type":"LinkedIn Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/Iamamandanoelle","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"My name is Amanda Wilcox Patterson.

I started the Instagram account @roseseason in 2014, being one of the first social media accounts promoting the rosé lifestyle. I knew I was onto something when I would go on work trips and come back to a desk stacked full of wine. The last few years of my life can be defined in five words: Rosé made me do it. My experience is in finance and happiness, and my wine knowledge stems from the stems of the wine glasses I have drank. And finding a business model where I can slay and rosé, rather than slay then rosé, makes me happy. Rosé Season is now my full-time hustle, growing as a lifestyle brand and a marketing and consulting business. I design and sell apparel, accessories and home goods for rosé, brosé and frosé drinkers, and for their kids and pets. I also recently partnered with FrutaPop to sell boozy ice pops, which have taken the Internet by storm! Additionally, Rosé Season provides marketing, editorial and consulting services to any brand and business whose target audience aligns with the rosé lifestyle. As seen on ABC News, NBC's Late Night with Seth Meyers, and Bravo's Summer House.

My photos are bright, clean and I always try to share a story with them. \n\nI've had the pleasure of working with several brands like Asos, Forever21, Yves Saint Laurent Beauty, Calvin Klein and UGG. As a traveling blogger & vlogger I also often work with hotels and travel agencies.","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.liangalliard.com"},{"categories":["Fashion","Style","Fashion Blogger","Mother","Beauty Blogger"],"follower":"111k","location":"Los Angeles, California","name":"Zia Domic","path":"https://influence.co/huntercollector","reach":"111k","engagementRate":"1.9%","likePerPost":"2.0k","commentPerPost":"46","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/huntercollector"},{"follower":"106k","link":"https://instagram.com/huntercollector","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"2.8k","link":"https://twitter.com/ZiaDomic","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"1.4k","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/huntercollect/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zia-domic-8940aa8","type":"LinkedIn Link Click"}],"bio":"Canadian Born, LA Based Actor, Mother & Fashion Addict","demographics":"Female","website":"http://thehuntercollector.com"},{"categories":["Fashion","Lifestyle","Style","Travel","Snapchat"],"follower":"468k","location":"Miami, Florida","name":"Sebastian | Espe","path":"https://influence.co/twotrends","reach":"468k","engagementRate":"1.6%","likePerPost":"7.4k","commentPerPost":"128","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/twotrends"},{"follower":"463k","link":"https://instagram.com/twotrends","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"2.4k","link":"http://facebook.com/388201831346063","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"659","link":"http://www.twotrends.com","type":"Blog Link Click"},{"follower":"3.1k","link":"https://twitter.com/TwoTrends","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/Twotrendsnap","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://www.youtube.com/twotrends","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"TwoTrends is a Fashion & Lifestyle blog targeted for both men and women.

Working as a Personal Trainer, Benjamin attended the Art Institute of Philadelphia part time and followed his passion of cooking and graduated with an Associates in Culinary Arts. Benjamin, has worked as a Chef at some of the top restaurants in Philadelphia and San Francisco. After spending 16 year in the kitchen, Benjamin decided to turn to his other passion. \n​ \nBenjamin didn't set out to be a photographer... \n\nIt just kind of happened. \nIn his own words: \n\nI suppose it's possible that it's what I do because my father was an avid photographer and I do admire the man a great deal. I couldn't tell you why for sure. What I can tell you is that I really love what I do and I spend a lot of time refining, perfecting and even obsessing over my work... It is a passion. As a youngster growing up in Easton, PA, I would help my father develop his photography. Throughout the years I learned many helpful skills from my father. To this day he plays a major role in my development as a photographer. ​ \n\n​I'm a Published Photographer focused on capturing the pure essence of beauty. I have been shooting for the past 15 year. Over the past 2 years I've stepped up my game and am working on building my name and business. ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ I have spent a lot of time reflecting on things such as what is my \"style\" of photography. Style comes with time and is a difficult thing to force. I feel, more important than style is being aware of the literal nature of the image I see and striving to go beyond that in an aesthetic sense to create a captivating image.","demographics":"Male, 41 years old","website":"http://www.BenjaminBrignolaPhotography.com"},{"categories":["Fashion","Food","Lifestyle","Recipes","Fashion Blogger"],"follower":"19.9k","location":"Chicago, Illinois","name":"Public Lives, Secret Recipes","path":"https://influence.co/publiclivessecretrecipes","reach":"19.9k","engagementRate":"1.6%","likePerPost":"283","commentPerPost":"14","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/publiclivessecretrecipes"},{"follower":"18.2k","link":"https://instagram.com/publiclivessecretrecipes","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"1.6k","link":"https://twitter.com/PLSR_official","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/plsr_food","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://youtube.com/publiclivessecretrecipes","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"interview people in the public eye & share their secret recipes | create recipes & sell #KRISPOPS | CHI \npubliclivessecretrecipes@gmail.com #plsrfood","demographics":"Female, 26 years old","website":"http://www.publiclivessecretrecipes.com"}]
