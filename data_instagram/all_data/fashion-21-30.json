He grew up a son of a single mother, raising three boys. He learned to sew with needle point and cross stitch at the age of five from his grandmother. \n\nAfter graduating High school in 2003, the designer's first step off the island was to live in Ottawa, the Country's capital. This move was a stepping stone for him as it marked his first real contact with the fashion world. This experience was a motivation for him as he decided to pursue fashion as a full time career and enrolled and studied at the Academy Of Design and Technology in Montreal, Quebec in 2004. He graduated in 2006 with an AEC in Fashion Design. \n\nHe quickly became recognized for his flare and talent in the city. He began creating custom-made designs for various private clients. He then became head designer for a Quebec based fashion brand (Historia), providing elegant & casual ready-to-wear garments for men and women. Garments were sold in the major malls of Quebec, after his run with the company he took on the challenge of fabric creation & graphic design for a decor company, Lawrence Home Fashion also based in Montreal. \n\nAlthough successful at his work, James felt that there was a disconnection between his day to day duties and his own creative aspirations. As a result, the designer took a step back from the mainstream industry and redirected himself towards his own vision to create a line of men’s casual garments. Following this change of career priorities, James was able to fully focus on his creations and his vision. He fully discovered and experienced Montreal's vibrant music, dance and art culture. James went through various cycles that broke down a lot of walls and boundaries he needed to overcome. The people he met and connections he forged had a tremendous influence on the evolution of the man he would grow to become. \n\nAfter a couple years, the designer decided to take a break from the cycles and swing of Montreal, to go to Edmonton for a year. There, he lived with his younger brother to regroup, while working and managing internationally renowned retail stores. A year later he moved to Vancouver where James was able to focus on the creation of his signature line of men’s casual garments. The line debut was at Vancouver’s Evolution event in 2011. This event showcases fashion designers and dance talents in the city. Shortly after, he showed the same collection to Parisian audiences at Gala International in Paris, France in 2011. \n\nAfter Vancouver, James moved to Toronto. In the biggest city in Canada, James explored new designs and made his first set of 3 women's dresses that he shot with his muse & dear friend. While in Toronto, he worked on his collection (Broken Hearts & Fairy Tails), Shown at FAT - Fashion Arts Toronto in 2014.Following Toronto. James Moved back to Montreal where he feels he belongs. That’s where he has been creating and developing his craft and nourishing his soul, with the re-launch of SERINO in May 2016. \n\nSERINO \nHailing from Canada, a mosaic land of vibrant cultures, Serino's pieces not only represent the multi facets of his talent but also that of Canadian society, and specifically it's masculine counterparts. Beyond the obvious reflection of his designs that parallel the ancient Greek and Roman art form, lies a deep ideology which Serino embodies - that all beings are beautiful and that all should be included. Audiences will be pleased to see various male models representing different cultures strut down the runway in harmony with the designs and ethos of James Serino. A truly Canadian artist, his muse is not one single person, but the many people which colour his life and experience adding further to the solidity of his beliefs and designs.","demographics":"Male","website":"http://www.jamesserino.com"},{"categories":["Beauty","Fashion","Photography","Style","Travel"],"follower":"6.7k","location":"Los Angeles, California","name":"jessfashion101","path":"https://influence.co/jessfashion101","reach":"6.7k","engagementRate":"8.0%","likePerPost":"454","commentPerPost":"37","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/jessfashion101"},{"follower":"6.1k","link":"https://instagram.com/jessfashion101","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"253","link":"https://twitter.com/JessFashion101","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"292","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/jessfashion101/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/jda2got","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/user/JessFashion101","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"Hello Hello, I'm Jess! \n\nI was born & raised in the suburbs of LA - I am the definition of the Mexican-American heritage that has flourished here in SoCal.

My name is Tania and I am a fashion and fitness lover :) I live in Germany since I am a child, but I was born on the beautiful island of Mauritius. You should know about me that I love to travel and I love photography. I am a very enthusiastic and friendly person. I discovered on social media that I am very creative and have an eye for details and esthetics. It has become my passion to style different outfits as well as to find nice spots to take pictures at. My social media has been growing and I enjoy that I have found a hobby I am very passionate about. I already worked with several brands and I love making content for these. I would like to continue doing that and I am very happy to work with brands who are interested in working with me. When working with me, you can be sure to get professional and dedicated Behaviors and content that you will love. Please contact me on my Instagram @tan_i_a_ma or per e-mail: tania.ma@web.de \n\nThank you.

This delightfully entertaining show explores what would happen if the princesses we all know and love jumped out of the fairy tale and into the real world. Naturally, things would be much different and the princesses would need help to navigate their new surroundings. Not to worry, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty befriend some lovely little girls and begin their exploration of the real world. Through their adventures the princesses learn about new technology such as FaceTime & Netflix, health tips for when you catch a nasty cold, Holidays like Fourth of July, and they even go to a magical pool party where everyone turns into mermaids! Core morals, values and lessons of empowerment are shared in each episode to help children remember how important it is to be active and play outside, take care of your health, be a kind and caring friend, embrace your inner beauty, and the like. The goal of Princess Perplexity is to be a fun and entertaining place for all children and children at heart; and to bring quality filming, writing, and performing to life with a modern twist on the classic characters we have all grown to know and love. So sit back relax and prepare to be dazzled. \n\nOur ultimate goal is to attract well over 1 million views on each video, obtain 100k+ subscribers, and to one day be the largest princess and children's YouTube/virtual platform.","demographics":"Female","website":"https://www.princessperplexity.com"},{"categories":["Fashion","Lifestyle","Decor","Make Up, Beauty Blogger"],"follower":"99.4k","location":"Spain","name":"Any Rey","path":"https://influence.co/dorytrendy","reach":"99.4k","engagementRate":"2.6%","likePerPost":"2.9k","commentPerPost":"87","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/dorytrendy"},{"follower":"114k","link":"https://instagram.com/dorytrendy","type":"Instagram Link Click"}],"bio":"ѕтяєєтѕтуℓє | fαѕнισи | ιиѕρσ \nA Coruña, Spain \nCompra mis looks aquí","demographics":"Female","website":"https://www.vinted.es/miembros/80174-dorytrendy"},{"categories":["Branding","Fashion","Photography","Publishing","Photographer"],"follower":"10.3k","location":"Warsaw, Masovian Voivodeship, PL","name":"Dawid H.
