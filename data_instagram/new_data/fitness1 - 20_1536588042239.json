Boasting an instantly recognisable look, Nathan combines street wear with a luxe twist for modern men’s style with an edge. \n\nBorn in Newcastle NSW, Nathan moved to Sydney’s Northern Beaches as a child. This coastal upbringing no doubt influenced his relaxed approach to combining unique pieces with a casual yet polished vibe that has left many asking him “Where did you get that?” \n\nNathan’s journey to becoming a style influencer started when he was working in events and photography, snapping shots of stylish guests at night clubs and Sydney’s hottest venues. While he certainly had an eye for finding interesting style in others, it was soon his own sartorial choices that where becoming the focus. With his distinctive look and creative combinations, he would often have people asking him what he was wearing and where he got his outfits from. \n\nWhilst he only started to really take his Instagram account seriously just over a year ago, Nathan has already built an impressive following of engaged fans who draw daily inspiration from his fashion, men’s grooming and lifestyle posts. As with any Instagram sensation, Nathan has the magic touch for creating a coherent story with his pictures, making his account a scroll-worthy destination for men looking for fresh, fashion forward content. \n\nNathan also has a popular Tumblr page The Addicted Youth which he created just on 3 years ago. Using it as his virtual inspiration board, Nathan combines hot-off-the-fashion week runways shots, his top picks from international collections, style inspiration, his own photography work and lifestyle quotes for a visually engaging culmination of all the elements that influence Nathan’s personal style. \n\nAs a passionate foodie, traveller and all-round curator of style Nathan effortlessly combines gorgeous flat-lays from his favourite restaurants, cafes, bars, travels and accessories into his fashion-forward Instagram stream – generating a seamless guide to living for the modern male. \n\nWith his broad appeal and youthful, contemporary approach to fashion, Nathan has been an obvious choice for brands looking to create meaningful engagement with consumers.

Boasting an instantly recognisable look, Nathan combines street wear with a luxe twist for modern men’s style with an edge. \n\nBorn in Newcastle NSW, Nathan moved to Sydney’s Northern Beaches as a child. This coastal upbringing no doubt influenced his relaxed approach to combining unique pieces with a casual yet polished vibe that has left many asking him “Where did you get that?” \n\nNathan’s journey to becoming a style influencer started when he was working in events and photography, snapping shots of stylish guests at night clubs and Sydney’s hottest venues. While he certainly had an eye for finding interesting style in others, it was soon his own sartorial choices that where becoming the focus. With his distinctive look and creative combinations, he would often have people asking him what he was wearing and where he got his outfits from. \n\nWhilst he only started to really take his Instagram account seriously just over a year ago, Nathan has already built an impressive following of engaged fans who draw daily inspiration from his fashion, men’s grooming and lifestyle posts. As with any Instagram sensation, Nathan has the magic touch for creating a coherent story with his pictures, making his account a scroll-worthy destination for men looking for fresh, fashion forward content. \n\nNathan also has a popular Tumblr page The Addicted Youth which he created just on 3 years ago. Using it as his virtual inspiration board, Nathan combines hot-off-the-fashion week runways shots, his top picks from international collections, style inspiration, his own photography work and lifestyle quotes for a visually engaging culmination of all the elements that influence Nathan’s personal style. \n\nAs a passionate foodie, traveller and all-round curator of style Nathan effortlessly combines gorgeous flat-lays from his favourite restaurants, cafes, bars, travels and accessories into his fashion-forward Instagram stream – generating a seamless guide to living for the modern male. \n\nWith his broad appeal and youthful, contemporary approach to fashion, Nathan has been an obvious choice for brands looking to create meaningful engagement with consumers. Lending his street style cool to everything from shoes to jeans and eyewear, Nathan has worked with brands including; Croft Shoes Melbourne, Glue Store, Top Man, Bonds, Lynx, A Brand Jeans, Hartley Watches and Dita Eyewear to name a few.","demographics":"Male, 26 years old","website":"http://www.nathantito.com"},{"categories":["Bodybuilding","Fitness","Athlete"],"location":"Sacramento, California","name":"Kortne Greene","path":"https://influence.co/bsn_kg_1","reach":"29.9k","engagementRate":"2.1%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/bsn_kg_1"},{"follower":"29.1k","link":"https://instagram.com/bsn_kg_1","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"861","link":"https://twitter.com/Ms_KG_1","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/mskg1","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.gobsn.com"},{"categories":["Fitness","Food","Health and Wellness","Bikini","Blogger"],"location":"Los Angeles, California","name":"Abby Austin","path":"https://influence.co/alafitness_","reach":"40.7k","engagementRate":"1.7%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/alafitness_"},{"follower":"35.3k","link":"https://instagram.com/alafitness_","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"5.4k","link":"http://facebook.com/836011229811398","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8QsffpRLD3LX6fwZeNinQg","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"I am a bikini competitor, flexible dieter, and fitness coach encouraging women to become the best version of themselves through Always Living Active!

I am a Fitness & Pilates Expert. I currently reside in the other Brooklyn- Oakland, California. I began my full time Fitness career path after watching the Twin Towers fall on September 11, 2011. I ran out my office and onto 34 Street, in my hometown of New York City. The black smoke filled the sky and in that moment I knew working in fashion was not my calling. Fitness was, my love and passion. Helping others navigate on a path to inner and outer fitness, was what I wanted to contribute to the world. I knew the time was then….. \n\nI had already received my certification in Personal Training and Group Fitness. I quickly became one of Crunch's most sought after female personal trainers and instructors from 2001- 2003. I also competed in the National Physique Committee's Ms. Fitness 2002 competitions, & placed 6th. Seeking a more spiritual connection in the world, as well as my body, I extensively studied Vinyasa Yoga and was certified on a 200 hour level with the Laughing Lotus. When discovered Pilates I truly fell in love with this body conditioning system. I started with a Pilates Mat and then a Comprehensive Apparatus 750 hour training with the late great Romana. In the last 15 years I have worked with competitive athletes, celebrities and advanced exercisers, but I am still able to challenge novices gradually and those with special needs safely and effectively. \n\n\nI created JFIT/ Pilates based on my 20,000 hours of experience both in New York and San Francisco It's all about the body in front of me! A workout with me (online or in person) could include any combination of a sweaty circuit weight session, my signature JFIT Pilates Mat classes, a kick-a$$ HIIT session, reformer strength work, Pilates Chair or Springboard routines, a kitchen makeover or even a burning barre booty blast. I have also been known to throw down a killer playlist to help get you through it all dancing. \n\nI specialize in helping busy urbanites (and post urbanites) navigate their health and fitness journeys into their hectic schedules. Fitness, just like life, should be enjoyable and I am here to helping you transform by providing customized fitness, Pilates and nutrition programs that reflect your goals, needs, motivations and preferences. Anybody can become healthier, anybody can eat better and train smarter, and anybody can feel amazing.

Working as a Personal Trainer, Benjamin attended the Art Institute of Philadelphia part time and followed his passion of cooking and graduated with an Associates in Culinary Arts. Benjamin, has worked as a Chef at some of the top restaurants in Philadelphia and San Francisco.

I couldn't tell you why for sure. What I can tell you is that I really love what I do and I spend a lot of time refining, perfecting and even obsessing over my work... It is a passion. As a youngster growing up in Easton, PA, I would help my father develop his photography. Throughout the years I learned many helpful skills from my father. To this day he plays a major role in my development as a photographer. ​ \n\n​I'm a Published Photographer focused on capturing the pure essence of beauty. I have been shooting for the past 15 year. Over the past 2 years I've stepped up my game and am working on building my name and business. ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ I have spent a lot of time reflecting on things such as what is my \"style\" of photography. Style comes with time and is a difficult thing to force. I feel, more important than style is being aware of the literal nature of the image I see and striving to go beyond that in an aesthetic sense to create a captivating image.","demographics":"Male, 41 years old","website":"http://www.BenjaminBrignolaPhotography.com"},{"categories":["Fitness","LGBT","Lifestyle","Vegetarianism"],"location":"São Paulo, São Paulo, BR","name":"Michelle Rogério","path":"https://influence.co/themicaloo","reach":"40.8k","engagementRate":"6.0%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/themicaloo"},{"follower":"27.7k","link":"https://instagram.com/themicaloo","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"13.1k","link":"https://twitter.com/themicaloo","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/themicaloo","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/micachai","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"","demographics":"Female, 25 years old","website":"https://youtube.com/micachai"},{"categories":["Actors","Fitness","Instagram","Snapchat"],"location":"Hollywood, California","name":"Sean Harris","path":"https://influence.co/sean.lamont","reach":"22.6k","engagementRate":"4.5%","likePerPost":"919","commentPerPost":"14","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/sean.lamont"},{"follower":"20.7k","link":"https://instagram.com/sean.lamont","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"2.0k","link":"https://twitter.com/YSFSean","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/YSFSean","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"Actor/Personal Trainer \n24yr old from from Mount Vernon, NY.

I am a Fitness & Pilates Expert. I currently reside in the other Brooklyn- Oakland, California. I began my full time Fitness career path after watching the Twin Towers fall on September 11, 2011. I ran out my office and onto 34 Street, in my hometown of New York City. The black smoke filled the sky and in that moment I knew working in fashion was not my calling. Fitness was, my love and passion. Helping others navigate on a path to inner and outer fitness, was what I wanted to contribute to the world. I knew the time was then….. \n\nI had already received my certification in Personal Training and Group Fitness. I quickly became one of Crunch's most sought after female personal trainers and instructors from 2001- 2003. I also competed in the National Physique Committee's Ms. Fitness 2002 competitions, & placed 6th. Seeking a more spiritual connection in the world, as well as my body, I extensively studied Vinyasa Yoga and was certified on a 200 hour level with the Laughing Lotus. When discovered Pilates I truly fell in love with this body conditioning system. I started with a Pilates Mat and then a Comprehensive Apparatus 750 hour training with the late great Romana. In the last 15 years I have worked with competitive athletes, celebrities and advanced exercisers, but I am still able to challenge novices gradually and those with special needs safely and effectively. \n\n\nI created JFIT/ Pilates based on my 20,000 hours of experience both in New York and San Francisco It's all about the body in front of me! A workout with me (online or in person) could include any combination of a sweaty circuit weight session, my signature JFIT Pilates Mat classes, a kick-a$$ HIIT session, reformer strength work, Pilates Chair or Springboard routines, a kitchen makeover or even a burning barre booty blast. I have also been known to throw down a killer playlist to help get you through it all dancing. \n\nI specialize in helping busy urbanites (and post urbanites) navigate their health and fitness journeys into their hectic schedules. Fitness, just like life, should be enjoyable and I am here to helping you transform by providing customized fitness, Pilates and nutrition programs that reflect your goals, needs, motivations and preferences. Anybody can become healthier, anybody can eat better and train smarter, and anybody can feel amazing.

The blog is a space for me to provide articles that challenge the misconceptions within the health and fitness industry. I want to show people that there are people on the internet whose information you can trust.\n\nNot everyone is out to make a quick buck from vulnerable individuals by selling a cookie cutter meal plan and a workout they copied from bodybuilding.com! I might come across harsh but it’s only because I am so passionate about what I do. \n\nI am a qualified Strength and Conditioning Coach (CSCS) with an honours degree in sport, nutrition and exercise science and I take my job very seriously. I’ve put a lot of time, money and effort into expanding my knowledge. \n\nThis industry is saturated with unqualified and biased coaches who think of it as an easy career path. Of course, I’m not saying that all coaches are like this, I would like to think that the majority are qualified and passionate coaches like myself, whose input is the kind that people can listen to and respect. \n\nI provide free information on my blog simply to help as many people as I can. The things I write about are things that I find people are constantly bombarded with online, things that have conflicting opinions and theories. My aim is to do the research and provide an unbiased opinion that people can trust. \n\nI currently work in a medical university here in Bahrain, providing fitness and nutrition consultations/coaching to staff and students alike. I work with clients including staff who have office jobs and just want to improve their health through fitness, as well as student doctors who want to improve their overall lifestyle in order to be able to practice what they preach to their future patients. \n\nAs obesity is such a big epidemic in the region, it’s clear that the education around nutrition and training just isn’t up to scratch. It’s my aim to provide people with as much information and knowledge on these subjects as I can, so people can learn how to start to improve their lifestyle for the better. \n\nEnough of the serious stuff, what else do I do? Outside of my full-time job, I am currently working alongside the GAA team here, The Arabian Celts, as their Strength & Conditioning coach as we head into the 2016-17 Middle East GAA season. \n\nAs well as this, I am an online nutrition and training coach and run the fat loss programme \"Learn'2'Lose\". \n\nI am a huge lover of good food, the gym, travelling and the odd motivational quote here and there  So, to get a real insight into my day to day life and the things I enjoy, you can follow me all over social media @caloriesandcarbs and snapchat (@calsandcarbs).","demographics":"Female","website":"http://caloriesandcarbs.net/"},{"categories":["Dallas","Fitness","Faith","Lifestyle","Fashion & Beauty"],"location":"Dallas, Texas","name":"JaLisa E.

He resided in Istanbul till he was 13 years old, where he participated in various team sports together with individual performance sports. \n\nIn 2003, he moved to Barcelona, Spain with his family. He concentrated on excelling at basketball with the goal of playing for FC Barcelona Basquet and simultaneously competed in an amateur full contact kick boxing league. \n\nIn 2006, via a self-initiated weight cut, he found cysts on his body that needed to be surgically removed as the tissues could potentially carry cancer cells. Following the operation, he then noticed an abnormality on his left leg. What appeared to be a harsh bruise turned out to be a bone tumor on his left femur. \n\nAfter a successful 7-hour surgery, the large tumor was removed and the femur was reinforced with a strip of cadaver bone. The operation rendered Ilkay unable to move without walking aids for the duration of two years. Doctors told him he may never be able to walk again. \n\nIlkay refused to accept the fate that was instilled by the doctors and heavily invested his time in rehab. In 2010, he decided to move to Montreal to continue his BCOMM education at a prestigious business school in Montreal, JMSB of Concordia University. \n\nHe fully recovered from his operation and decided to take up martial arts. The relentless effort displayed by Ilkay led him to become a very talented mixed martial artist after 3 years of consistent training for over 4 hours (on average) a day. With the aid of his instructors, Sifu Sebastien and Kru Ryan Parsons, he started teaching mixed martial arts to others. He is currently training to fight at a heavier weight class. \n\nOn the business side, Ilkay has worked in a variety of industries, such as retail & wholesale jewelry, interior design, electronics manufacturing services, SaaS, and the Fitness & Wellness industry. He assumed positions in Sales, Business Development, and Customer Success in the companies he worked with. \n\nUsing his knowledge and experience gathered throughout his lifetime via practicing various types of functional and strength based sports, he has created the world’s most balanced training methodology, LIBRAFORTE.","demographics":"Male","website":"http://www.IlkaySky.com"},{"categories":["Adventure Travel","Fitness","Blogger","Photographer","Paddleboarding"],"location":"Charlotte, North Carolina","name":"Nicole","path":"https://influence.co/itsnicolewils","reach":"7.4k","engagementRate":"2.6%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/itsnicolewils"},{"follower":"6.5k","link":"https://instagram.com/itsnicolewils","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"938","link":"https://twitter.com/nicolewilsonn","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"61","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/nicwilson19/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/wilsonnicole19","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB_QWnp87n4ZnlbrVGqp9jQ","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"Just a girl from Canada exploring her interests.

I never tell my clients to stay away from these places, instead, I give the knowledge and skills to go out and make the right choices to live a practical AND healthy life.","demographics":"Female, 29 years old","website":"http://bit.ly/2kioh3w"},{"categories":["Fitness","Health and Wellness","Veganism","Yoga","Exercise"],"location":"Tennessee","name":"Jenna  Hello Naturally","path":"https://influence.co/jbabyfit","reach":"558","engagementRate":"38.1%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/jbabyfit"},{"follower":"183","link":"https://instagram.com/jbabyfit","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"0.0","link":"http://facebook.com/156081184853484","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"6.0","link":"https://twitter.com/jbabyfit","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"369","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/jbabyfit/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/jenn_mar","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjzbN7YJ1oLjrFHeOw-_qXw","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"Blogging my life as I improve myself and helping you do so as well! :).","demographics":"Female","website":"http://jbabyfitness.wixsite.com/hellonaturally"},{"categories":["Dance","Fitness","Makeup","Modeling","Snapchat"],"location":"Ohio","name":"Kat Genovese","path":"https://influence.co/katgenovese","reach":"499","engagementRate":"10.0%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/katgenovese"},{"follower":"443","link":"https://instagram.com/katgenovese","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"17","link":"http://facebook.com/378410849177957","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"39","link":"https://twitter.com/kat_genovese","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/kittykatgeno","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"My name is Kat, and I am an aspiring print and lingerie model based in Ohio. \n\nSome of my greatest accomplishments to date are overcoming my low self esteem, and turning the pain of being bullied for most of my life into beauty through my photos. It is my hope that by showing my pure self confidence, I will inspire young girls and women to be unapologetically, themselves. \nI have been modeling for the better part of my 27 years. Recently, I have upped the ante. My work with Red Dot Studios led me to a featured role in the music video for \"Awkward Phase\" by the band Eternal Boy. In addition to my appearance in their music video, I also work closely with the founder of Red Dot Studios for a recent photo shoot. I mostly work with Kate Scott, of Kate Scott Photography. One on one with Kate, I work regularly to enhance my portfolio and bring an artistic flair to my already unique, and sultry style of modeling. \nI like to think that I bring a look that speaks volumes to every photo taken of myself. My background in dance gives me the ability to take direction and translate it into natural, intimate movements. My features give me the ability to conjure any emotion asked. \n\n\n\"Kat is not only a beautiful face, she is a partner in creating art. She is willing to do anything for the image, from getting into a murky river to getting in a tub of milk water. She knows her angles and finds her lighting.

However, in a way, it was worse than you’d imagine. \n\nI ate for fun. \nI was good at it and people expected it of me (being the tallest and biggest in my family). \nI enjoyed showing off how much I could really pack in. \n\nProve it, you say? \n\nI ate a 49oz steak in ONE sitting on my 18th birthday! I was 6’2″ and 145lbs soaking wet. Not to mention I ate my salad, bread, lobster bisque, AND my chocolate birthday cake. Extrapolate that type of eating over the next 9 years and it shouldn’t come as a surprise that I was exhausted all the time and that my cholesterol was high; despite my physical appearance being that of a fit, healthy person. I did try to eat healthy, despite my feats of eating; a large chunk of meat and a couple steamed veggies was my usual meal. Maybe some bread and dairy thrown in as well. \n\nIn my defense, I was misinformed. I thought we HAD to eat meat, that every meal should contain meat, and that animal protein was the holy grail to building muscle. I was in my twenties and taking prescription medication to reduce my cholesterol. I needed a change. \n\nFive years ago, I started taking a close look into what I ate and I’ve been healthier ever since. \n\nIt took some through investigating and retraining of my food values. As soon as I made the switch to a Plant Based Diet, I immediately felt better. Within one week, I noticed positive benefits. I spent my time from then until now reshaping my diet and also spreading what I have learned to my friends, family, and anyone else who would listen. \n\nIn 2014 I decided to make my knowledge official and I got certified as a Plant Based Nutritionist through the T. Colin Campbell Center for Nutrition Studies (The leading authority on Plant Based Nutrition) in association with Cornell University. \n\nI like eating, I always have. Now I eat as much as I want, packing my body full of nutrients, and I’m all the healthier for it. At 6 ‘2″, 200lbs, I’m the physically strongest and mentally sharpest I have ever been. The sleepy haze is gone and has been replaced with bountiful energy and unwavering focus. \nI’d love to talk to you about how you too can feel better than you’ve ever felt. \nWishing you the change you deserve. \n-Ryan Furman","demographics":"Male","website":"http://MainlyPlants.com"},{"categories":["Anime","Blogging","Fitness","Modeling","Motivation"],"location":"Petaling Jaya, Selangor, MY","name":"Vania Mania","path":"https://influence.co/vaniamania","reach":"9.8k","engagementRate":"3.7%","likePerPost":"348","commentPerPost":"4","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/vaniamania"},{"follower":"9.5k","link":"https://instagram.com/vaniamania","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"271","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/vaniamania/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vania-quah-83840852","type":"LinkedIn Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/vaniamania13","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/user/vQuah","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"I see the world through my own lens & I am a strong believer of being authentic in the things that I share.","demographics":"Female","website":"http://vaniamania.wordpress.com/"},{"categories":["Bodybuilding","Fitness","Health and Wellness","Nike","Apparel"],"location":"Youngstown, Ohio","name":"Shirlee","path":"https://influence.co/shirleesimon","reach":"5.0k","engagementRate":"2.4%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/shirleesimon"},{"follower":"3.6k","link":"https://instagram.com/shirleesimon","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"1.2k","link":"https://twitter.com/_shirleesimon","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"181","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/s1m7s/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://periscope.tv/shirleesimon","type":"Periscope Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/shirleesimon","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"I'm a professional dancer turned persoanl trainer.

However, in a way, it was worse than you’d imagine. \n\nI ate for fun. \nI was good at it and people expected it of me (being the tallest and biggest in my family). \nI enjoyed showing off how much I could really pack in. \n\nProve it, you say? \n\nI ate a 49oz steak in ONE sitting on my 18th birthday! I was 6’2″ and 145lbs soaking wet. Not to mention I ate my salad, bread, lobster bisque, AND my chocolate birthday cake. Extrapolate that type of eating over the next 9 years and it shouldn’t come as a surprise that I was exhausted all the time and that my cholesterol was high; despite my physical appearance being that of a fit, healthy person. I did try to eat healthy, despite my feats of eating; a large chunk of meat and a couple steamed veggies was my usual meal. Maybe some bread and dairy thrown in as well. \n\nIn my defense, I was misinformed. I thought we HAD to eat meat, that every meal should contain meat, and that animal protein was the holy grail to building muscle. I was in my twenties and taking prescription medication to reduce my cholesterol. I needed a change. \n\nFive years ago, I started taking a close look into what I ate and I’ve been healthier ever since. \n\nIt took some through investigating and retraining of my food values. As soon as I made the switch to a Plant Based Diet, I immediately felt better. Within one week, I noticed positive benefits. I spent my time from then until now reshaping my diet and also spreading what I have learned to my friends, family, and anyone else who would listen. \n\nIn 2014 I decided to make my knowledge official and I got certified as a Plant Based Nutritionist through the T. Colin Campbell Center for Nutrition Studies (The leading authority on Plant Based Nutrition) in association with Cornell University. \n\nI like eating, I always have. Now I eat as much as I want, packing my body full of nutrients, and I’m all the healthier for it. At 6 ‘2″, 200lbs, I’m the physically strongest and mentally sharpest I have ever been. The sleepy haze is gone and has been replaced with bountiful energy and unwavering focus. \nI’d love to talk to you about how you too can feel better than you’ve ever felt. \nWishing you the change you deserve. \n-Ryan Furman","demographics":"Male","website":"http://MainlyPlants.com"},{"categories":["Beauty","Fitness","Fashion","Food","YouTube"],"location":"United States","name":"Mavis Slade","path":"https://influence.co/mavslade","reach":"2.3k","engagementRate":"3.9%","likePerPost":"88","commentPerPost":"2","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/mavslade"},{"follower":"2.3k","link":"https://instagram.com/mavslade","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://periscope.tv/mavslade","type":"Periscope Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/mavslade110","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://www.youtube.com/channel/mavslade","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.youtube.com/mavslade"},{"categories":["Beauty","Fitness","Health and Wellness","Makeup","Family Lifestyle"],"location":"Melbourne, Victoria, AU","name":"Yasmin Coulthard","path":"https://influence.co/loveyasminoxo","reach":"3.6k","engagementRate":"1.7%","likePerPost":"50","commentPerPost":"6","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/loveyasminoxo"},{"follower":"3.2k","link":"https://instagram.com/loveyasminoxo","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"375","link":"http://facebook.com/1474016479481563","type":"Facebook Link Click"},{"follower":"77","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/YasminCoulthard/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/blondeyas","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"Wife, Mum,  Business Owner  Changing people's lives one person at a time.

A 24-year-old foodie, living in London. I’m a qualified yoga teacher, social media manager, and fitness junkie. \n\nOriginally hailing from sunny Glasgow, Scotland. I upped and moved my life to the big smoke late last year. I was in need of a new adventure and to re-ignite my zest for life. \n\nSince being here I have quickly realized my passion in life is all things food. I have taken it upon myself to expand my food horizons, and try as much of the London food scene as I can.I’m not a wellness blogger, but I’m also not going to be only eating ribs and burgers (but boy, do I love a burger) Nevertheless, my blog aims to be about balance. I’m aware that balance is becoming the buzzword of 2017, much like #cleaneating defined 2016. In a world that has been so full of negativity, I actually think this is a massive progression! Let’s just get back on an even keel! \n\nMy background in a nutshell \n\nRecovered from an eating disorder, learned to love me, found joy in food, now want to help others do the same! \nI’m not in any way a recovery blog. Anyone who used to read my previous blog will know I used to talk a lot about this, and mental health. There will be snippets and anecdotes about how I coped. However, this isn’t a guideline of how to live your life. What I do might not be healthy all the time, and what works for one person most likely won’t suit everyone. \n\nOne thing I urge you to do, don’t trust anyone trying to sell you their ‘plan’ because at the end of the day you are the only one who knows your body best. Hungry? Eat good food. Full of energy? Move more. \n\nLet’s make eating good food, with proper everyday ingredients (note: gluten) NORMAL again! \n\nEmbrace your body for how it is right now because it’s amazing and keeping you alive! PLEASE, enjoy every second you have in it! \n\nAint No room for self-hate here!","demographics":"Female","website":"https://eatingsandthinkings.wordpress.com/"},{"categories":["Fitness","Fashion","Food and Drink","Lifestyle","Travel"],"location":"Amersfoort, Utrecht, NL","name":"junetwonl","path":"https://influence.co/junetwonl","reach":"4.6k","engagementRate":"4.2%","likePerPost":"137","commentPerPost":"32","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/junetwonl"},{"follower":"4.0k","link":"https://instagram.com/junetwonl","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"60","link":"http://www.june-two.nl","type":"Blog Link Click"},{"follower":"403","link":"https://twitter.com/junetwonl","type":"Twitter Link Click"},{"follower":"152","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/alexaoptland/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexa-op-t-land-ba590197","type":"LinkedIn Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/xalexie","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDDDhIQoTM8avEHJuwq7Z2w","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"24 years old girl, living in the Netherlands.

My name is Jeff Kline and a brief history of myself, I'm 26 years old and originally from Flint, MI where my passion for fitness began like many others, through athletics. As a high schooler, I was a three sport athlete in football, basketball, and track & field. Many of the accolades that I accumulated included 6-times USATF Track & Field All-American, 2-times State Champion in Long Jump, current state record holder in the Long Jump, and Academic All-State in Football. Along with graduating with a 4.0gpa, I accepted a Full-Ride Football and Track scholarship to the University of Michigan where I earned a degree in Political Science and History for Secondary Education. After not pursuing a professional athletic career, I found a job as a high school history teacher. Not being full-time in an athletic/fitness field drove me crazy, so I had to find something different. I moved to Grand Rapids, MI and for the past few years I have been the Regional Training Director at a fitness center with 14 locations in West Michigan. \n\nAs far as my fitness industry experience, once I moved to Grand Rapids in 2014 I received a Fitness Modeling contract after doing a shoot for a photography teacher at a local university who needed some shots to help build his portfolio. Since then my social media presence has grown tremendously with over 100k followers on Instagram and over 30k on Snapchat. I do a number of public appearances and hold demos for all of my companies I work with. My influence at work has produced a huge number of sales as well. I do all of the regional sales of the Personal Training, so I am also in charge of putting together their nutrition and supplement recommendations. I am consistently in the top three throughout the entire company in terms of gross sales each month so I definitely know how to sell a product and create value. I also travel quite frequently to Los Angeles and Chicago for photo shoots and just had two USA Today best selling authors purchase two of my book covers for their new series. Other companies I do promotional work for include a commercial for Nike, NF Sports, Young & Reckless, Six Pack Bags, Barbell Apparel, and many more. I absolutely love to work with a driven team, and help generate sales through great partnerships, next level communication skills, and of course simple hard work and dedication. \n\nTo be a top tier athlete you have to be willing to work harder than anyone when no one is watching, and also do all of the things no one else is willing to do. That is the same mindset that I grew up with and carry with me to this day.","demographics":"Male, 27 years old","website":"http://www.jeffklinefitness.com/"},{"categories":["Beauty","Burlesque","Fitness","Lingerie","fetish"],"location":"Detroit, Michigan","name":"Roxi D'Lite","path":"https://influence.co/roxi_dlite","reach":"107k","engagementRate":"2.7%","likePerPost":"2.3k","commentPerPost":"34","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/roxi_dlite"},{"follower":"86.9k","link":"https://instagram.com/roxi_dlite","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"20.7k","link":"https://twitter.com/Roxi_Dlite","type":"Twitter Link Click"}],"bio":"Burlesque, circus and fetish showgirl.

Everyone is talking about those so called “influencers” nowadays, they’re the ones who change the world. Based on what they wear, use, do and share on their social media they influent teens and other Instagram users. \n\nOn Instagram, we’ve got the famous huge influencers with 1 million followers, but we also got smaller influencers which remain undiscovered. That’s why we’re writing this blogpost, today we want to introduce you to one of our recently discovered accounts: @fistofbuddha, a so called “new kid on the block”, if we’re talking about amazing undiscovered influencers you should know about then there’s no way you can miss out on this one. \n\nMario posts high quality variating content every day, Mario really interacts with followers by asking their opinion on daily stuff making you as a follower feel more connected to the account. So far Mario managed to grow the following of the account to over 33368 already, an impressive amount in such a short timespan!\n\nToday, if you want to get in touch with this so called “influencers” and have them promote your brand, most people will think of accounts with 100,000 followers or more. They will go to the biggest names in the industry, and understandably so. The more powerful an influencer is, the more valuable their promotion will have. But as competition for the big influencers begins to grow we’ll likely see more diversity among influencer targets and see smaller influencers popup. In other words, we’ll see influencers of all levels, including the high-follower elite and low-follower newcomers like Mario, getting attention from brands. \n\nThe other big shift that we’re going to see is a more active approach to our otherwise passive social profiles. What I mean by this is that, right now, our social accounts, Twitter profiles, Instagram and Facebook accounts are all passive representations of our actual personality, aspirations, thoughts, feelings. But the platform itself does not actually engage with the user on the other side. It doesn’t talk back when someone interacts with it. That’s something Mario is doing really well, really engaging with the followers on the account.","demographics":"Male, years old","website":"https://medium.com/@jacobernst/professional-mma-fighter-mario-wittmann-2f97c6e39dba"},{"categories":["Fitness","Fashion","Health","Lifestyle","Model"],"location":"New Albany, Indiana","name":"Kim Jeanette","path":"https://influence.co/kimjeanette.official","reach":"38.4k","engagementRate":"6.2%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/kimjeanette.official"},{"follower":"38.4k","link":"https://instagram.com/kimjeanette.official","type":"Instagram Link Click"}],"bio":"Model | Influencer | Dancer Booking:kimjeanette.booking@gmail.com.","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.thefreeyoga.com"},{"categories":["Business","Fitness","Fashion","Photography"],"location":"Göteborg, Västra Götaland, SE","name":"Eyad_Alkh","path":"https://influence.co/eyad_alkh","reach":"48.6k","engagementRate":"0.6%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/eyad_alkh"},{"follower":"48.6k","link":"https://instagram.com/eyad_alkh","type":"Instagram Link Click"}],"bio":"","demographics":"Male","website":"https://www.woodwatches.com/g/eyadalkh"},{"categories":["Fitness","Fashion","YouTube","Modeling","Snapchat"],"location":"Frankfurt am Main, Hesse, DE","name":"JAVI  SOMERSAULT","path":"https://influence.co/javisomersault","reach":"12.6k","engagementRate":"7.5%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/javisomersault"},{"follower":"12.6k","link":"https://instagram.com/javisomersault","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/javi_somersault","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCatBbH6-zqllXvxXoRr1Fdg?spfreload=10","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"Most recognized for his lot of popular works as a videographer with lot of famous djs from all around the world, this 19 years old is the creativity personified.

When I am innovating, I am in my element, which is why I have such a love for creative marketing. \n\nFrom an online and social media marketing perspective, my brand not only serves as a platform for marketing my own products and services, but also works extremely well as a space to advertise for brands within the lifestyle, fitness, health and travel space - because my audience trusts and values what I have to say. I have always made sure to collaborate with and advertise for brands that align well with the essence and values of my own brand. I do not believe in promoting just anything – rather, the campaigns I like to get involved with are those that integrate seamlessly into the themes and topics that define my platform. I believe in purposeful, well-strategized collaborations that result in great value add for all parties involved.","demographics":"Female","website":"https://www.caralishious.com"},{"categories":["Fitness","Fashion","Kids and Babies","Lifestyle","Mom"],"location":"Los Angeles, California","name":"Sherly Deras","path":"https://influence.co/miss_sherls","reach":"46.8k","engagementRate":"3.0%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/miss_sherls"},{"follower":"46.8k","link":"https://instagram.com/miss_sherls","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/miss_sherls","type":"Snapchat Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVEkbtRbOampCcHNNBnU6aA","type":"Youtube Link Click"}],"bio":"I love Fashion and Fitness.

What exaclty does that mean? I run and train with a vareity of different groups and gyms across the valley. I'm also an instructor at multiple cycling studios. I run, I ride, and I practice my OCR skills. Truly a \"jack of all trades\". I also help organize events for all of these different organizations and buisnesses that I have connections with. I love bringing people I know together so everyone can benefit from the relationships I've built. \n\nI'm also just as acitvie on social media as I am in the local community. The best part is always meeting someone at an event that I've engaged with on social (both locally and outside of AZ). Many social influencers have a strong social presence, but stick to a small community bubble. I'm well rounded in that the whole city is my bubble, and my social platforms only help expand that bubble! \n\nLast but not least, I have a background in marketing and promotions. I have a good eye for images and creativity.","demographics":"Male","website":"http://confessionsofanamateurathlete.blogspot.com"},{"categories":["Beauty","Fitness","Health and Wellness","Model","Fitness Models"],"location":"Gold Coast, Queensland, AU","name":"Megan Granville","path":"https://influence.co/megan_granville","reach":"24.7k","engagementRate":"2.8%","likePerPost":"697","commentPerPost":"21","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/megan_granville"},{"follower":"25.6k","link":"https://instagram.com/megan_granville","type":"Instagram Link Click"}],"bio":"Health & Fitness Enthusiast \nBikini/Fitness Competitor & Model \nNatural Health Advocate \nSponsored Athlete Ambassador \nOnline Marketing Influencer \nHealth & Fitness for Women \nPositive Role Model \nCanadian living in Australia \nEmail: meggyg@gmail.com","demographics":"Female, 35 years old","website":"https://influence.co/megan_granville"},{"categories":["Bars","Fitness","Food","Health and Wellness"],"location":"Utah","name":"G2G Protein Bar","path":"https://influence.co/g2gbar","reach":"25.5k","engagementRate":"","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/g2gbar"},{"follower":"25.4k","link":"https://instagram.com/g2gbar","type":"Instagram Link Click"}]},{"categories":["Fitness","Fashion","Health","Running","Travel"],"location":"Dallas, Texas","name":"Jessica Tondre","path":"https://influence.co/jessrunsblessed","reach":"49.5k","engagementRate":"3.1%","likePerPost":"1.4k","commentPerPost":"111","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/jessrunsblessed"},{"follower":"48.8k","link":"https://instagram.com/jessrunsblessed","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"765","link":"http://facebook.com/1684021325150421","type":"Facebook Link Click"}],"bio":"Runner, blogger, mom, wife, clean eater and fitness lover who loves sharing my love of all things health related with others and spreading my passion for adventure and living life to the fullest!","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.jessrunsblessed.com"},{"categories":["Fitness","Health","Lifting Weights","Running","Fitness Models"],"location":"New Haven, Connecticut","name":"Mary J","path":"https://influence.co/itsamarython","reach":"16.2k","engagementRate":"3.2%","likePerPost":"493","commentPerPost":"16","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/itsamarython"},{"follower":"16.1k","link":"https://instagram.com/itsamarython","type":"Instagram Link Click"}],"bio":"I coach running and lifting. \nI run my own business. \nI enjoy coffee, cats, and writing.","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.itsamarython.com"},{"categories":["Blogging","Fitness","Food","Health and Wellness","Weight Training"],"location":"Lincoln, England, GB","name":"Ashleigh Ponder","path":"https://influence.co/balancednotclean","reach":"26.0k","engagementRate":"1.3%","likePerPost":"330","commentPerPost":"7","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/balancednotclean"},{"follower":"26.0k","link":"https://instagram.com/balancednotclean","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/balancednotclean","type":"LinkedIn Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/ashponder","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"As the creator of the viral food movement #balancednotclean with over 400,000 Instagram posts worldwide, I emphasise the importance of enjoying a balanced and healthy diet. \n\nMy influential role within the eating disorder community and food blogging sphere has lead to worldwide recognition from media outlets such as the BBC, BuzzFeed and ABC News. \n\nYou can see the various interviews and articles below: \n\nBBC UK National 6PM News report: https://youtu.be/FFl54Ygd7U4 \n\nBBC Radio 4 interview: https://youtu.be/-1Xm4Efmw0I\n\nMy first BBC Radio Lincolnshire interview: https://youtu.be/1zi6An6gF8E \n\nBuzzFeed article feature: http://www.buzzfeed.com/krishrach/the-girls-using-instagram-to-recover-from-anorexia#.ju0RkXK58Q \n\nGraze.com's Blog Feature: http://blog.graze.com/post/124163013724/balancednotclean\n\nI have also been featured on BBC Radio Lincolnshire because of the release of my recent recipe and eating disorder recovery ebook because of its success: \nhttps://youtu.be/sRV1D3AmMLY \n\nI believe I have a particularly strong relationship with my followers because of how they have followed and supported my eating disorder recovery journey. Now I have grown into my own skin and become more confident, my followers look to me as a source of inspiration, guidance and advice. I enjoy helping others online, because if it wasn't for those who supported me initially on the Internet, I would not be here. \n\nI believe I have shown a strong work ethic throughout everything I have done online so far. I am currently studying for my A Levels so that I may progress to university to realise my dream of obtaining a degree in sports science. I will then use this to continue to make a positive impact upon the health and fitness industry with accredited qualifications and research supporting these efforts. I don't want to force people to change - I want to use further education to build upon my current experience to practically empower them in improving their physical and mental health. \n\nI may only be a teenager, but I take my responsibilities as an influential online account seriously. To some, the Internet 'is not real' - to me, the Internet is a brilliant way of connecting like-minded individuals so we may make the world a better place together.","demographics":"Female, 19 years old","website":"http://www.balancednotclean.com"},{"categories":["Fitness","Motorcycles","Tablets","iPhones","Cycling"],"location":"Irvine, California","name":"Rokform","path":"https://influence.co/rokform","reach":"19.3k","engagementRate":"","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/rokform"},{"follower":"14.7k","link":"https://instagram.com/rokform","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"4.6k","link":"https://twitter.com/ROKFORM","type":"Twitter Link Click"}]},{"categories":["Fitness","Food","Pets"],"location":"California","name":"AXEL","path":"https://influence.co/pupaxel","reach":"17.0k","engagementRate":"1.9%","likePerPost":"316","commentPerPost":"11","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/pupaxel"},{"follower":"17.2k","link":"https://instagram.com/pupaxel","type":"Instagram Link Click"}],"bio":"Hello, I'm a friendly pup that loves to explore the human world.

Until recently, that beast had a one-track mind and desired nothing other than to become a Professional Dancer. This dream dates back to Primary School; at my Grade 7 Graduation, we had a “When I Grow Up” slideshow and my picture had Professional Dancer written under it. Finally, after years of blood, sweat and tears, all of my hard work was reassured. Mid-semester in my final year of high school, I was accepted into The School of Contemporary Dancers’ Senior Professional Program in Winnipeg, Canada. While this was a dream come true, my Dad would not consider it as an option, but my desire to pursue it was too big to contain. Thankfully Mum was on my side- women power! So, with the help of my incredible school teachers I finished my Grade 12 assessments a few months early, belted out some Bon Jovi, It’s My Life, to my Dad (amongst other highly convincing tactics thanks to my Mum) and on September 2nd, 2011, I touched down in Winnipeg ready to conquer full-time dance training. It was then that I learned that if I wanted something bad enough, my inner beast would do whatever it takes to make it happen. \n\nFlash forward to 2016 – As scary as it is to admit it, this beast no longer has a one-track mind. My original dream has grown and changed along with me. Finding fulfillment in areas of my life that I haven’t prioritized in the past five years, as well as gaining new life experience, has opened my eyes to other possibilities, layering my inner beast’s desires. Since graduating from professional training, I have explored interests parallel to my initial dream and have continued to learn and grow. I’ve danced professionally. I’ve expanded my love of movement to a career in personal training and fitness. I have taught dance at the recreational and pre-professional level and have most recently been teaching dance to children in a community outreach program. I’ve discovered a passion for writing and have spent more time outdoors. I’ve had a part time job in an industry that was once outside my comfort zone and have learned to thrive in a new environment. After making the plunge to move to Canada, I’ve decided to go back to my roots, pursue further education and return to a community that helped to shape who I am. \n\nWhen we trust our instincts, the path becomes clear. I want to help you find your inner beast.","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.beastralia.com/pumpkin-pie-oatmeal/"},{"categories":["Coffee","Dogs","Fitness","Lifestyle","Coach"],"location":"South Carolina","name":"Love Always, Alyssa ","path":"https://influence.co/alyssab518","reach":"928","engagementRate":"4.7%","likePerPost":"","commentPerPost":"","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/alyssab518"},{"follower":"928","link":"https://instagram.com/alyssab518","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"","link":"http://snapchat.com/add/abwright620","type":"Snapchat Link Click"}],"bio":"Hi, I'm Alyssa! \n\nI am a young business professional working as a marketer by trade but my passion lies within sharing my love for health, fitness, balance and positive vibes. \n\nI've given my followers an inside look into my journey from being an overweight teen, to a pageant titleholder struggling with an eating disorder, to a college grad battle with Hashimoto's and hypothyroidism to my current stage of balance and health.

I truly feel that it has helped me become the best version of myself, while teaching me that there is always room to learn and grow. My goal is to share my passion and knowledge with others to inspire and help them gain self-confidence, to live their best lives and to achieve their goals, fitness or non-fitness related!","demographics":"Male, 22 years old","website":"http://kevinslife.org/"},{"categories":["Fitness","Fashion","Lifestyle","Travel","Food And Drinks"],"location":"Austin, Texas","name":"Jane Kim","path":"https://influence.co/janehkim","reach":"2.0k","engagementRate":"21.3%","likePerPost":"338","commentPerPost":"86","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/janehkim"},{"follower":"2.0k","link":"https://instagram.com/janehkim","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"45","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/janehkimblog/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"}],"bio":"A lifestyle and travel blog curated by Jane Kim. \nSharing all things Austin, travel guides, lifestyle, and photography. \nhello@janehkim.co","demographics":"Female","website":"http://www.janehkim.co/"},{"categories":["Children","Fitness","Humor","Parenting","Family Lifestyle"],"location":"California","name":"SoCal_PhenomoMom","path":"https://influence.co/socal_phenomomom","reach":"219","engagementRate":"9.8%","likePerPost":"17","commentPerPost":"2","socialAccounts":[{"follower":"","link":"https://influence.co/socal_phenomomom"},{"follower":"179","link":"https://instagram.com/socal_phenomomom","type":"Instagram Link Click"},{"follower":"39","link":"https://www.pinterest.com/chrislizcano/","type":"Pinterest Link Click"}],"bio":"I love being a mom and being an expert in child development I know the stresses of family life.

For the ones who don't here is a little bio of myself. I married my best friend 9•21•13. We don't have any children (yet), we do have two dogs (Yorkie & Doberman) they keep us busy. \n\nI've been an orthodontic assistant for 7 years now and I absolutely love my job. \n\nFitness became a passion of mine about two years ago. The first year I wasn't all in, I would just go to the gym a few days a week and workout and leave. Little did I know my body was building muscle. One day I left the gym and came home and was looking in the mirror and I started to see definition. Most of you know back in high school I was never big, I was always the smallest person and prob never made it to 100lbs on the scale. When I got out of high school I gain a little weight nothing big, but just enough to make me wanna hit the gym. So for the past year I have kicked ass everyday. My body has formed into a shape that I have always wanted. I still have a ways to go, but I couldn't be happier with the results I have started to see. \n\nMy daily routine is working out 5-6 days a week, I do take a pre workout and a post workout and try to do my best on eating healthy and taking in a lot of protein (what girl doesn't love pizza) yes sometimes I have cheat meals. We are all human and it's life! \n•••••••••••••••••• \nSo...I'm super excited to be apart of this group and I'm here to help get you on track with fitness. Motivation is the number one key.
